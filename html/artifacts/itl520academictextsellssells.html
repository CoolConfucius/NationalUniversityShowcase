	<p><strong>Emerging</strong></p>
	<p>The California English Language Development Standards describe this proficiency level as follows. Students are learning to use English for immediate needs as well as beginning to understand and use academic vocabulary and other features of academic language. They typically progress very quickly. Providing them substantial linguistic support can help them engage in complex, cognitively demanding social and academic activities requiring language (CA Board of Education).</p>
	<p><strong>Expanding</strong></p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The California English Language Development Standards describe this proficiency level as follows. Students are challenged to increase their English skills in more contexts. They learn a greater variety of vocabulary and linguistic structures. They learn to apply their growing language skills in more sophisticated ways appropriate to their age and grade level. Providing them moderate linguistic support will be sufficient to help them engage in complex, cognitively demanding social and academic activities requiring language (CA Board of Education).</p>
	<p><strong>Bridging</strong></p>
	<p>The California English Language Development Standards describe this proficiency level as follows. Students continue to learn and apply a range of high-level English language skills in a wide variety of contexts. They are able to comprehend and produce highly technical texts. For them to engage in complex, cognitively demanding social and academic activities requiring language, providing linguistic support beyond the light extent may not be necessary (CA Board of Education).</p>
	<p><strong>Non-Standard Variations of English</strong></p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An example would be the African American Vernacular English. Students who primarily speak AAVE may have difficulty communicating with English speakers unfamiliar with AAVE. Some people consider AAVE to be ungrammatical English. However, the blogpost &ldquo;What is AAVE&rdquo; describes AAVE has having consistent grammatical rules (Jones, 2014). AAVE students may struggle in classes because their teachers do not consider AAVE to be academically appropriate. While many educators may hesitate to incorporate AAVE to their schools, there has been support that recognizing AAVE in schools may benefit more students (Deak, 2007).</p>

	<p><strong>Academic Text 1: w3schools </strong></p>
	<p><strong>2.1.</strong></p>
	<p>The text I selected is retrieved from w3schools. W3schools is a website that provides good documentation for tools developers use such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. W3schools has a reputation of being easier for learners to understand compared to MDN. It is often a first go-to resource for programmers. The text I selected is a documentation page on the JavaScript While Loop. There is no restriction on grade levels. The while loop is an introductory level programming concept. Students will be expected to understand variables and conditionals.</p>
	<p><strong>2.2.</strong></p>
	<p>The page begins with a short definition of general loops: &ldquo;Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specific condition true&rdquo; then a definition and syntax of the while loop: &ldquo;the while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.&rdquo; The given is:</p>
	<p>while (<em>condition</em>) {<br /> <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; code block to be executed</em><br /> }</p>
	<p>This is then followed by an interactive example with an explanation:</p>
	<p>In the following example, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 10:</p>
	<p>while&nbsp;(i &lt;&nbsp;10) {<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; text +=&nbsp;"The number is "&nbsp;+ i;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i++;<br /> }</p>
	<p>(w3schools).</p>
	<p>Clicking the &ldquo;Try it Yourself&rdquo; button will show the outputs produced by the while loop.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The next section in the page is titled &ldquo;The Do/While Loop&rdquo; which is a variant of the while loop. It gives a short and simple definition of the do/while loop, gives the syntax, and an interactive example with an explanation. The section after that is titled &ldquo;Comparing For and While&rdquo;. The for loop is a little more complex than the while loop. This section compares the for loop and while loop and gives two interactive examples. The two examples are code accomplishing the same output, but uses a for loop while the other uses a while loop. Students can also learn about the JavaScript For Loop on w3schools (w3schools). The words and sentences used are relatively easy for new learners to understand without getting help from outside resources.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Academic Text 2: MDN web docs </strong></p>
	<p><strong>2.1.</strong></p>
	<p>The text I selected is retrieved from MDN web docs. MDN is a website that provides detailed documentation for tools web developers use such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Compared to w3schools, MDN has a reputation for being more difficult for learners to understand. It is said that programmers go to w3schools to learn the main idea of a concept, then go to MDN for in-depth details. The text I selected is a documentation page on loops and iteration in JavaScript. There is no restriction on grade levels. Iteration is an introductory level programming concept. Students will be expected to understand variables and conditionals.</p>
	<p><strong>2.2.</strong></p>
	<p>The page begins with a statement and example:</p>
	<p>You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction then Y steps in another; for example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:</p>
	<p>var step;</p>
	<p>for (step = 0; step &lt; 5; step++) {</p>
	<p>&nbsp; // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; console.log('Walking east one step');</p>
	<p>}</p>
	<p>There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times (and it's actually possible that number could be zero). The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others (MDN).</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>This opening statement is not as technical compared to that of other MDN pages such as the page on JavaScript variables. This is followed by a list to help navigate the page:</p>
	<p>The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:</p>
	<p>for statement</p>
	<p>do...while statement</p>
	<p>while statement</p>
	<p>labeled statement</p>
	<p>break statement</p>
	<p>continue statement</p>
	<p>for...in statement</p>
	<p>for...of statement</p>
	<p>(MDN).</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>For each item, the page defines the term, gives the syntax and explanation of the syntax, then a code example and an explanation for it.</p>
	<p>In the while statement example, the definition and syntax are given as follows:</p>
	<p>A &ldquo;while&rdquo; statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A &ldquo;while&rdquo; statement looks as follows:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>while (condition)</p>
	<p>&nbsp; statement</p>
	<p>If the condition becomes &ldquo;false&rdquo;, &ldquo;statement&rdquo; within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The condition test occurs before &ldquo;statement&rdquo; in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, &ldquo;statement&rdquo; is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following &ldquo;while&rdquo; (MDN).</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>This is followed by two examples with explanations. The first example is:</p>
	<p>var n = 0;</p>
	<p>var x = 0;</p>
	<p>while (n &lt; 3) {</p>
	<p>&nbsp; n++;</p>
	<p>&nbsp; x += n;</p>
	<p>}</p>
	<p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:</p>
	<p>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</p>
	<p>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</p>
	<p>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</p>
	<p>After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>
	<p>(MDN).</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>While not clean and straight to the point like w3schools, the terms used in this page are relatively non-technical by MDN standards.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;To students of this level, I do not think there are English words on the page that are too challenging for them. They should be able to understand the English words just fine.

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>There are a number of considerations that I, as a teacher, must have when using academic texts in computer science with students in my class who are less experienced with Mainstream Standard English.</p>
	<p>The texts will be in Standard English, but because students are expected to be familiar with Standard English, but because the best computer science / programming resources are written in Standard English, and I want to give my students the best. All code is in the JavaScript Programming Language. I expect that my students may benefit greatly from language related support. As a teacher, I will do my best to give them that support while still fulfilling my responsibility to teach my content area.</p>
	<p>I can imagine how these learners may respond differently to the reading text explaining computer science concepts. However, when it comes to coding, students of different proficiency levels and non-Standard English students will logically be on a level playing field when it comes to reading and writing code. Programming languages follow an entirely different syntax from spoken / literal languages. While programming terms are borrowed from the English language, they have unique meanings in the context of coding.</p>
	<p>For example: &ldquo;while&rdquo; is a word from English, but has a unique meaning in programming. In programming, the while loop is consistent across various programming languages such as JavaScript, Java, and C++. When coding in JavaScript, while is followed by a conditional closed under parentheses, then followed by a block of code closed under square brackets. While the condition is true, the block of code executes continuously, until the condition becomes false. Whether or not the students are familiar with while in the English context, they cannot know what while means in programming without first learning it.</p>
	<p>I have always understood that some students may need more support than others. I do not expect this understanding to change. No matter what level my students are coming from, I strive to provide them the right amount of support: enough support for them to learn and enough room for them to grow.</p>
