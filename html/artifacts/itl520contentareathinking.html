					<p>COMMON CORE STANDARD IN YOUR CONTENT AREA</p>
					<p><em>What is the language of the standard?</em></p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>The subject I want to teach is Computer Science / Programming. The language of this standard is best reflected as a &ldquo;Science and Technical Subjects&rdquo; in the ELA Standards. This is in the document &ldquo;California Common Core State Standards: English Language Arts &amp; Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects&rdquo; adopted by the California State Board of Education August 2010 and modified March 2013. &nbsp;Page 83 of the document provides the &ldquo;Reading Standards for Literacy in Science and Technical Subjects&rdquo; for grades 6 to 12 in a table. I find multiple items from this table to be very applicable to my computer science class. For example:</p>
					<p>"Determine the meaning of symbols, key terms, and other domain-specific words and phrases as they are used in a specific scientific or technical context"</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Here, the symbols and key terms can mean Computer Science terms such as &ldquo;variables&rdquo;, &ldquo;conditionals&rdquo;, &ldquo;loops&rdquo;, &ldquo;arrays&rdquo;, &ldquo;objects&rdquo;, or &ldquo;recursion&rdquo; or programming symbols such as the assignment operator, the equal operator, parentheses for function parameters, or square brackets for iterating code.</p>
					<p>This item from the table may also be applicable:</p>
					<p>&ldquo;Follow precisely a complex multistep procedure when carrying out experiments, taking measurements, or performing technical tasks; analyze the specific results based on explanations in the text.&rdquo;</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>While this seems intended for a natural science lab activity, learning to code also involves following procedures. This comes in the form of typing code to create a solution to a problem, compiling it to see the results, and then debugging the code if needed.</p>
					<p>Starting from page 86, the document provides the &ldquo;Writing Standards for Literacy&rdquo; in the subjects in a large table. Applying the items in this table in a Computer Science / Programming class in a practical way may be challenging. Student will be writing a lot of code, but I can think of opportunities for students to write English to develop their computer science understanding. This can come in the form of asking students to read a piece of code, then, using English, write down what the code is performing, and what output would it give and why.</p>
					<p>English Speakers at the Basic Level and at the Proficient Level are described in &ldquo;The NAEP Reading Achievement Levels by Grade&rdquo;. I expect both Basic Level and Proficient Level English Speakers to perform well with the language in my content area. In terms of language, their challenge would be learning the new terms. If I were to differentiate between the two levels, English Speakers of the Basic Level may be more likely to ask for help when working with unfamiliar terms. Proficient Level English Speakers may be more likely to figure out unfamiliar terms by looking at the context, patterns, or studying available resources.</p>
					<p>English Language Learners PDL Emerging and PDL Bridging are defined in the document "California English Language Development Standards Kindergarten Through Grade 12" adopted by the California State Board of Education November 2012. When it comes to language, Emerging Learners may have trouble understanding the texts in my class. They may only be familiar with English words they use for their immediate needs. Multiple words in my content area are not words that help with their immediate needs. To support them as their teacher, I may have to frequently define those unfamiliar terms for them. I expect Bridging Learners to have minimal difficulty with the language in my content area.</p>
					<p>The English variation discussed in this course&rsquo;s resources is the AAVE. The blogpost &ldquo;What is AAVE&rdquo; describes and discusses AAVE, providing its grammatical rules (Jones, 2014). Standard English learners who are used to processing language in series of short simple sentences may be frustrated at the long complex sentences that appear. Fortunately, long complex sentences should be rare in my class materials. When it comes to learning new terms, I think the Standard English Learners should have no more difficulty than the other learners.</p>
					<p>The video &ldquo;Helping Struggling Readers&rdquo; on the nctv17 channel talks about the struggles Dyslexic students face when reading and how teachers can help those students. When it comes to language, I expect Dyslexic students to struggle with the language on printed text</p>
					<p>Fortunately, the materials I will be using will be accessible digitally and they can be read aloud by software programs.</p>
					<p>For all of my students, when the language is understood, their success in my class will depend on their programming knowledge problem-solving skills, and my role is to help them achieve that success. The JavaScript programming language is equally foreign to all learners new to programming.</p>

					<p>The post "Anderson and Krathwohl &ndash; Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy Revised: Understanding the New Version of Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy" discusses a revised edition of Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy that emphasizes on cognitive aspects of the learners. In my Computer Science / Programming class, there are standards in what students are expected to know and be able to do. They should be able to recognize or recall Computer Science concepts or programming terms from memory. When reading code, they can recognize what concepts or terms are applied in it. To demonstrate understanding, they should also be able to explain the concepts, terms, and the coding procedure. They should be able to apply what they learned by writing code. When working with complex code, they can analyze it, reorganize the code into interrelating parts. They can also evaluate the code, point out bugs or make recommendations for more efficient or more organized coding. Finally, they should be able to solve problems by creating solutions to coding challenges or build complex programming projects (Wilson, 2016).</p>

					<p>&nbsp;The post &ldquo;Using Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy to Write Effective Learning Objectives&rdquo; gives a clean summary of Benjamin Bloom&rsquo;s classification of different objectives and skills that educators set for their students. The words &ldquo;literacy&rdquo; and &ldquo;language&rdquo; are not found in the post. However, the six levels of Bloom&rsquo;s taxonomy can be applied to literacy and language in Computer Science. The six levels are:</p>
					<p>Remembering: Retrieving, recognizing, and recalling relevant knowledge from long‚Äêterm memory.</p>
					<p>Understanding: Constructing meaning from oral, written, and graphic messages through interpreting, exemplifying, classifying, summarizing, inferring, comparing, and explaining.</p>
					<p>Applying: Carrying out or using a procedure for executing, or implementing.</p>
					<p>Analyzing: Breaking material into constituent parts, determining how the parts relate to one another and to an overall structure or purpose through differentiating, organizing, and attributing.</p>
					<p>Evaluating: Making judgments based on criteria and standards through checking and critiquing.</p>
					<p>Creating: Putting elements together to form a coherent or functional whole; reorganizing elements into a new pattern or structure through generating, planning, or producing.</p>
					<p>(Shabatu, 2013).</p>
					<p>Remembering: students are exposed to Computer Science concepts, programming terms, and code. Understanding: students are able to explain Computer Science concepts, what the programming terms are used for, and explain what a piece of code is accomplishing. Applying: students are able to write JavaScript code, using what they&rsquo;ve learned about programming. Analyzing: given complex code with multiple functions and complex data structures, students are able to break the code into understandable parts and see how the parts interact. They may also read about complex sorting algorithms such as the Quick Sort and Merge Sort and be able to break them down into step-by-step procedures. Evaluating: given multiple sorting algorithms, students can form judgements on the efficiency of the algorithm; or given sorting task, students can propose a sorting algorithm best suited for the task. Given code, students can judge whether the code performs a task correctly or efficiently. Creating: students can create solutions to complex coding challenges as well as use coding to build projects such as websites.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;Starting at page 149 in Chapter 4, the "California English Language Development Standards Kindergarten Through Grade 12" document offers a section on Scaffolding. It states:</p>
					<p>The term draws from Vygotsky&rsquo;s (1978) notion of the &ldquo;zone of proximal development (ZPD)&rdquo;: the instructional space that exists between what the learner can do independently and that which is too difficult for the learner to do without strategic support, or scaffolding. Scaffolding is temporary help that is future-oriented. In other words, scaffolding supports students in how to do something today that they will be able to do independently in the future.</p>
					<p>The next page shows a graph that illustrates Scaffolding well. The dimensions of the graph are: Low Support and High Support; and High Challenge and Low Challenge.</p>
					<p>I can apply Scaffolding to various learners in my Computer Science / Programming Class.</p>
				</td>

					<p><strong>Basic Level and Proficient Level English Speakers: </strong></p>
					<p>They are already familiar with the English language. To scaffold, I want to challenge them through coding challenges and give them support when needed. I can suggest them to read more challenging texts and use more technical words in their speech.</p>
				</td>
				<td colspan="2" width="174">
					<p><strong>English Language Learners PDL Emerging:</strong></p>
					<p>&nbsp;Many terms used in my class will be unfamiliar to these students. Their challenge is to familiarize themselves with those words. To scaffold, I may start with presenting texts with less technical words and gradually include more technical words. I can support them by assessing their understanding and explaining the words and concepts frequently. Visuals and demonstrations will be useful strategies to help the learners understand concepts and words.</p>

					<p>The post "What EXACTLY Is Depth of Knowledge? (Hint: It's NOT a Wheel!)" summarizes and discusses Webb&rsquo;s Depth-of-Knowledge Model Context Ceilings. The words &ldquo;literacy&rdquo; and &ldquo;language&rdquo; are not found in the post itself, but are found in the tags. Moreover, literacy is commonly used as a synonym for knowledge. The model consists of four levels:</p>
					<p>DOK-1: Recall and Reproduction: What is the knowledge?</p>
					<p>DOK-2: Basic Application of Skills and Concepts: How can the knowledge be used?</p>
					<p>DOK-3: Strategic Thinking: Why can the knowledge be used?</p>
					<p>DOK-4: Extended Thinking: How else can the knowledge be used?</p>
					<p>(Francis, 2017).</p>
					<p>I can answer the questions of each level in the context of my content area. For DOK-1, students are learning Computer Science concepts and programming terms. At this level, I may ask students to explain how variables or loops work in programming. For DOK-2, students are applying their Computer Science and programming knowledge by coding. I may ask them to write a program that defines a variable, output that variable, and through a while loop, increment that variable and output it at each iteration. For DOK-3, I may task students with writing more complex code and teach them the concepts at a deeper level. We write code because that is the language computers understand. Coding is instructing computers to perform. For DOK-4, I want to ask my students to think about practical applications of coding. Websites are built from code. If my students know JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, they can build websites without using a templating tool such as WordPress.</p>

	<p><strong>Brief Reflection </strong></p>
	<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Connecting multiple major concepts from various sources has been a challenge. From studying the resources and working on this assignment, I learned a lot. I learned about: various categories of learners such as the six categories listed in this assignment; the Common Core ELA standards and how they apply to various subjects; Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy and cognition; Depth of Knowledge; and Scaffolding.</p>
	<p>Regarding strategies, I imagine that the Think Pair Share may be useful in my Computer Science / Programming class. Think: I want students to be thinking about what the concepts mean; and how to solve coding challenges. Pair Share: Students can work with others to share their thoughts and solutions to the challenges. A strategy that I know will be practical is frequent use of visuals and demonstration. Computer science is an abstract subject and will be challenging to learners used to thinking concretely. A computer science teacher I have observed used visual imagery to illustrate complex computer science concepts. For example, he compared the data structure array lists to a series of lockers. While learning in college and developer training programs, I also find coding demonstrations to be more useful than lectures.</p>
