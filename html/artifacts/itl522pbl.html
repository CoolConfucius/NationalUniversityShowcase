	<h1>Project-Based learning</h1>
	<p>Benjamin Huang</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Section 1</h2>
	<p>Identification and explanation of the main characteristics of Project-Based Learning</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Project-based learning is a dynamic classroom approach in which students actively explore real-world problems and challenges and acquire a deeper knowledge.</li>
		<li>In the typical professional environment, adults solve projects.</li>
		<li>Working on a project is a process of actively solving a problem.</li>
		<li>Success involves critical thinking, collaboration, and communication.</li>
		<li>Project-Based Learning makes school more like real life</li>
		<li>Focusing students on a project deepens their knowledge and builds skills they&rsquo;ll need in the future</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Section 2</h2>
	<p>Benefits of Project-Based Learning in Literacy and Language Development within Content Area</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Project-Based Learning makes school more like real life.</li>
		<li>It gives students opportunities to connect the work they do in school to the larger world around them.</li>
		<li>Focusing students on a project deepens their knowledge and builds skills they&rsquo;ll need in the future.</li>
		<li>Students learn content as well or better using PBL than with traditional instruction.</li>
		<li>Students remember what they have learned longer and are better able to use what they have learned.</li>
		<li>PBL provides opportunities to learn and practice: working in groups, making choices, monitoring progress, thinking deeply about a problem or challenge, and communicating what has been learned.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>PBL, Language, &amp; Literacy</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>PBL is incredibly compatible with a class in Computer Science / Programming.</li>
		<li>Working on a programming project is the best way for students to learn a programming language and computer science concepts.</li>
		<li>This is more effective than listening to or reading about definitions of terms.</li>
		<li>Trying to memorizing definitions is boring and ineffective in understanding the content area.</li>
		<li>Applying concepts by working on a project makes the learning more engaging and effective.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Section 3</h2>
	<p>Benefits of integrating Universal Design for Learning when implementing PBL for the development of content area literacy for English Speakers, English Language Learners, Standard English Language Learners, and Students with Special Needs.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Universal Design for Learning</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Multiple Means of Representation: the content area is represented in multiple ways through diverse / flexible projects. The projects represent the content area in ways that are suited to the learner.</li>
		<li>Multiple Means of Engagement: engage various students by incorporating their interests. In a class on building websites, I can engage students by showing that there are websites dedicated to their various interests.</li>
		<li>Multiple Means of Expression: through projects, learners can express their understanding of the content area in multiple ways.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Diverse Learners</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Through collaboration, students who struggle with the English language have opportunities develop their language skills by working with students fluent in the language.</li>
		<li>UDL includes representing the content area in ways that are accessible to students with special needs.</li>
		<li>For example, a software that reads aloud text makes the material accessible to dyslexic students.</li>
		<li>Success in the class is measured by the students&rsquo; learning of the content area, and they express their learning through projects</li>
		<li>All students have opportunities to succeed in the content area.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Section 4</h2>
	<p>Closing remarks and implications for instructional practice.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Project-Based Learning makes a lot of sense to me. My philosophy as a teacher is to help prepare students for their life after graduation or the professional environment.</li>
		<li>As a computer science / programming teacher, my mission is to help my students develop the skills needed to be successful in software development / engineering.</li>
		<li>The software field is all about projects. It makes sense to focus on projects to help prepare students for a field of projects.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Instructional Practice</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>A computer science / programming teacher I have observed seemed to have already applied PBL. I can learn from him on developing PBL lesson plans.</li>
		<li>The coding boot-camps I have attended apply PBL. I can learn how to teach by adopting the approach that helped me learn programming.</li>
		<li>My learners can start with simple projects then gradually tackle more complex projects as their learning progresses.</li>
	</ul>
