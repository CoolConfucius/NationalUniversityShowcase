	<h1>Discipline-Based Unit of Study</h1>
	<p>Stage 2: All about Teaching</p>
	<p>Benjamin Huang</p>
	<h1>Progression of Teaching</h1>
	<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
	<h2>Loops</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>In computer programming, a loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.</li>
		<li>It is a basic concept that is frequently used in software development.</li>
		<li>To help my young learners understand loops, I used the example of me walking from point A to point B.</li>
		<li>Beginning programmers may write a line of code that instructs me to take one step towards point B. They may copy that same line of code numerous times. There is a cleaner and more effective way to write this instruction using a loop.</li>
		<li>Pseudo code: I start at point A. While (I am not at point B) { I take a step towards point B }</li>
		<li>To help make the example concrete, I walked from one point in the room to another.</li>
		<li>Each time I take a step, I check to see if I am standing on point B.</li>
		<li>When I stand on point B, the loop&rsquo;s condition is met and the execution exits the loop.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Nested Loops</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>When learners are familiar with loops, they are ready to progress to learning nested loops.</li>
		<li>A nested loop is a loop within a loop, an inner loop within the body of an outer one.</li>
		<li>To help make the example concrete and understandable, I used the example of a clock, an object the learners should be familiar with.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>JavaScript code:</p>
	<p>var minutes = 0; var seconds = 0;</p>
	<p>while (minutes &lt; 60) {</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seconds = 0;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (seconds &lt; 60) {</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seconds++;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; minutes++;</p>
	<p>}</p>
	<ul>
		<li>To simplify this example, we set both the seconds and minutes to 0.</li>
		<li>The outer loop is responsible for incrementing the minutes while the inner loop is responsible for incrementing the seconds.</li>
		<li>Execution starts from the outer loop then immediately enters the inner loop.</li>
		<li>Inside the inner loop: While the seconds variable is less than 60, the variable increments. This means its value increases by 1. When the value becomes 60, execution exits the inner loop.</li>
		<li>Inside the outer loop: the minutes variable increments. The seconds variable is set to 0. Execution goes back into the inner loop.</li>
		<li>This cycle repeats unit the value of minutes reach 60. When the variable meets 60, execution finally exits the outer loop.</li>
		<li>When learners have understood nested loops, the may be ready to progress to more advanced concepts such as functions, and eventually, the complex concepts like recursion and sorting algorithms.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
	<h2>Scratch</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Most learners present are at the elementary school age.</li>
		<li>It is not recommended to present them to programming languages used in software development such as Java and JavaScript.</li>
		<li>Those programming languages are abstract and challenging to learn even at the beginning level, thus difficult for the learners to stay motivated.</li>
		<li>Scratch helps young learners progress in their programming education. Scratch is a visual programming language that is easy to learn. With a few simple steps, elementary school kids can build visual and audio projects with Scratch.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Painting with Pencils</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>While Scratch is simple, working on some Scratch projects does challenge the creativity and problem-solving skills of young learners.</li>
		<li>In the Scratch project Painting with Pencils, the learners are introduced to a wide range of scripts. Their task is to select and combine the right scripts to finish the project.</li>
		<li>Motion scripts such as &ldquo;go to mouse pointer&rdquo; instructs a sprite to go the mouse pointer.</li>
		<li>In my demonstration, I combined scripts so that, when the project is running, the pencil sprite follows my mouse pointer.</li>
		<li>Next, I added the script that lets the pencil sprite draw on the background.</li>
		<li>I added more scripts so that: when I press space, the pencil sprite draws in a changing color, making a rainbow; when I press c, the background clears.</li>
		<li>Bonus: I edited the scripts so that, instead of having the pencil constantly drawing, it draws when I press the down arrow key, and stops drawing, when I press the up arrow key.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>After Scratch</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>There are a lot of Scratch projects the learners can work on. With practice, students will become comfortable and proficient with Scratch.</li>
		<li>However, Scratch is a tool to help learners progress in their programming learning journey. Employers want developers proficient in JavaScript or Java.</li>
		<li>When learners are proficient in Scratch, I would encourage them to progress to a programming language like JavaScript. The programming concepts the learners learned in Scratch will apply to other programming languages. So, the transition for Scratch programmers will be smoother compared to learners completely new to programming.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h1>Addressing all Learners</h1>
	<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
	<h2>Leaners and their Needs</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The class is stated to be for children grades 1 to 6. This is quite a wide range.</li>
		<li>Age aside, some students had some experience in programming while others are starting new.</li>
		<li>Some students showed strong interest in programming while others appeared to be forced to be in the class by their guardians.</li>
		<li>Information on special needs are not given to me.</li>
		<li>A first grader named April couldn't read the text on screen. To address her need, I or another instructor will point at their screen and read the text aloud to her. As one instructor stated, &ldquo;April needs someone to hold her hand all the way&rdquo;.</li>
		<li>On Day 1, a boy refused to participate in class. Chris, the founder of BATA, told us to give him space and just make sure he is safe. Throughout the class time, the boy either sat at the bench outside the classroom or sat at a corner table drawing on paper with markers.</li>
		<li>On Day 2, the same boy participated in class.</li>
		<li>One boy was working on his tasks with his screen in Spanish.</li>
		<li>There was a 7th grade girl and a 9th grade girl among the students, even though the class was stated to be for grades 1 to 6.</li>
		<li>They seemed unmotivated and were not doing the work. The tasks may have been too easy for them, or they feel embarrassed about being surrounded by elementary schoolers.</li>
		<li>I try to make them feel respected. They may be in the same class with children and toddlers, but I recognize them and speak to them as adolescents. I think this made them feel more comfortable.</li>
		<li>One boy was throwing pens at other students and verbalizing insults and threats of violence.</li>
		<li>This was uncomfortable for me to watch, especially when the other instructors were not taking any action.</li>
		<li>I walked up to the boy&rsquo;s table and looked at him. I was not sure what to say. Fortunately, my presence and proximity was enough for him to stop harassing his classmates.</li>
		<li>Other students told me they felt unsafe around the boy and thanked me for intervening.</li>
		<li>Towards the end of the session, one girl named Allison said that the class was fun. She asked me if she can come back to learn more. I was very touched by this. Hearing a student say she enjoys learning made me feel like I succeeded as an instructor.</li>
		<li>In Painting with Pencils, a girl named Audrey not only implemented the scripts I talked about in my bonus less, but added her own scripts that let her build a more complex and advanced project.</li>
		<li>In her project, she drew a girl, a great drawing for something done in Scratch. I asked her if she would be okay showing her project to the class. She said no, and I respected her wish.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h1>The Teaching Stage</h1>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Social Emotional Thriving and Academic Achievement</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Throughout this program, I have talked about how important it is for me to build a safe learning environment for my learners.</li>
		<li>I want my learners to feel safe and encouraged so they can participate in learning without feeling attacked. I believe this is optimal for academic achievement.</li>
		<li>Despite the importance, I feel stumped. There are difficult questions such as: What if the students struggle with the most basic tasks? What if students expressed a strong dislike towards being in class? What if students are hostile to their peers and teachers?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>My Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>In this experience, I consider my strength to be my proficiency in my content area. My experiences as a JavaScript developer transferred well into skills as a Computer Science and Programming teacher.</li>
		<li>For example, my experiences with and understanding of abstract concepts such as loops help me break them into examples that are more absorbable to the learners.</li>
		<li>I consider my weakness to be my nervousness and responding towards various student needs.</li>
		<li>I can think of challenging classroom scenarios, but I do not know how to best approach them.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h1>Videos</h1>
	<p>The first two videos are recorded by my digital camera. The quality is poorer than I expected, so I switched to recording with my phone, which gives a better quality. The later three videos are recorded with my phone.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h1>Reflection</h1>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Reflection: Learner</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>This experience seemed to demonstrate that different learners need different teaching approaches.</li>
		<li>To students who excelled or enjoyed learning, I praise them for their work and efforts, and encourage them to keep up the great work or positive attitude.</li>
		<li>Students who struggled with the simplest tasks, expressed dislike towards the class, or were hostile to their peers made me nervous.</li>
		<li>I want students to learn, but never want them to feel like they are being forced to learn. What would a successful educator do?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Reflection: Target</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>This experience gave me a new appreciation for Scratch.</li>
		<li>A college professor recommended starting programming with C++, a language known to be more complicated than Java. Others suggest starting with JavaScript, a language simpler than Java.</li>
		<li>Seeing how some students struggle with Scratch, I can imagine how much more they would struggle with C++ or JavaScript.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Reflection: Instruction</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>I think I made the right choice wearing a suit jacket. I may consider wearing a tie to boost my authority.</li>
		<li>I think I spoke too fast. I should remind myself to speak more slowly. It is a common advice given in public speaking. A deeper voice may also help me sound more confident.</li>
		<li>I get a sense of nervousness reading my body language. I may work on expressing a more relaxed body language to show that I am in control.</li>
		<li>I think I had the right idea simplifying abstract concepts with concrete examples.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Reflection: Assessment</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The students are assessed by their progress on their code.org challenges and their Scratch project.</li>
		<li>The students are tasked to complete a series of fun visual coding challenges on a website. The programming language used is similar to Scratch, involving easy, visual, drag-and-drop scripts.</li>
		<li>One challenge is to program scripts that command a zombie to find the sunflower.</li>
		<li>The Painting with Pencils project assessed the students&rsquo; proficiency with Scratch. Some struggled to program what I demonstrated. Others programmed all that I demonstrated and even went beyond.</li>
	</ul>
