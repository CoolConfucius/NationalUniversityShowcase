    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This essay compares the role of teachers depicted in three different articles and analyzes the practical implications from the articles. The article, Harriet Bishop, Frontier Teacher, follows the experiences of the schoolteacher Harriet Bishop in the mid-1840s in St. Paul Minnesota. The second article, The Exhausting Life of a First-Year Science Teacher, describes Amit Reddy’s life as a contemporary American teacher. The third article, How Finland Starts the School Year, discusses the educational climate in Finland, a country that is academically strong by international standards. </p>

    <h1>Comparative Essay</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      I often hear American education criticized for not preparing students for success or for losing in the competition with the education in other countries. The task of improving the American education system is a complex problem. As a programmer would say, the logical approach to solving a complex problem is to break it down into manageable parts. This essay will mainly inspect the role of teachers. To discuss how to optimize the role of teachers for the success of American education, it would be helpful to compare the contemporary American teacher role to that of the past. Paying attention to what has changed may provide valuable insight on what further changes can be made for improvement. Moreover, it is logical to examine the typical work day and the challenges of the contemporary American teacher. Furthermore, it is practical to observe the role of teachers in a country ranked high in academic strength. Learning from successful role models is conventional wisdom. This essay will summarize three articles relevant to the role of teachers, compare those roles, and analyze the differences.

    <h2>Article I – Harriet Bishop, Frontier Teacher</h2>
    <p>
      In this article, Zylpha Morton provides an image of the education culture of mid-19th century Minnesota through the experiences of Harriet Bishop. The article does not directly compare American education in the 19th century with that of the 21st century, but the contrast is evident to the contemporary reader. The article states: 
    </p>
    <p><i>
      Harriet Bishop’s preparation for her post included a review of the common school subjects, in addition to lectures on domestic economy, health of children, punctuality, truth and honesty in the schoolroom, diet, how to avoid sectarian jealousy, how to deal with party politics, and how to meet petty gossip (Morton, 1947). 
    </i></p>
    <p>
      From this passage, the reader can conclude that, compared to their contemporary counterparts, Bishop and her colleagues at the time were more focused on teaching moral principles and life skills to their students. They were responsible for teaching academic content to their students, but not to the same extent as contemporary American teachers.     
    </p>

    <h2>Article II – The Exhausting Life of a First Year Science Teacher</h2>
    <p>
      In this article, Jackie Mader describes Amit Reddy’s life as a first-year science teacher working at a contemporary American school. Reddy is an educated individual. His accomplishments include earning an undergraduate degree in engineering, master’s degrees in literary nonfiction and public policy, working in advertising, studying in Australia and America, as well as publishing a book. To qualify for teaching, Reddy joined The New Teacher Project’s Teaching Fellows program, which is an alternative option to the traditional teaching path (Mader, 2016). Despite his expertise, his teaching job was incredibly challenging to him. Mader says “the job consumes his life. He’s barely been able to cook or read since he started teaching.” Reddy’s struggle on the job is most likely due to a combination of factors. A reader of this article may first suggest that Reddy struggled because he had less training than teachers who gone through the standard path. Another potential factor is that American schools have become a lot more academically rigorous over the past decades, and this increase in rigor may be demanding on teachers. The advanced academic rigor is likely to provoke resistance in some students, which makes the teacher’s job even more stressful. Furthermore, the average modern American school may be lacking resources or understaffed. With less resources and less teachers, each teacher must take on more work to meet the schools’ demands. 
    </p>

    <h2>Article III – How Finland Starts the School Year</h2> 
    <p>
      Walker begins his article stating that “Finnish students were academically advanced” and “excelled on international standardized tests” (Walker, 2016). He also says Finland’s teacher training programs are highly selective and that their “classroom teacher-training programs require five years of coursework, practicum, and thesis writing” (Walker, 2016). Readers with rigorous schooling backgrounds may expect the country with successful schools to be academically intense. To those readers and Walker’s surprise, the Finnish school atmosphere is laidback. At the end of his article, Walker states: 
    </p>
    <p><i>
      I saw that the most valuable thing I could do during those early days of school was relax—like my laid-back Finnish colleagues—and simply enjoy relationships with my students (Walker, 2016).
    </i></p>
    <p>
      The implication here is the academic success of Finnish schools come from providing students a positive learning environment. When students feel supported and have positive relationships with their teachers, they are likely more motivated to learn. When students want to learn, teachers do not need to discipline them into learning. My coding instructors like to say that working smart is accomplishing high quality work with minimum effort. I get the impression that Finland’s school are working smart. To someone who grew up in a Taiwanese educational system, I found this especially counter-intuitive and fascinating.  
    </p>

    <h2>Comparison and Contrast</h2>
    <p>
      By comparing Bishop’s experience to that of Reddy’s, one can notice the difference between the role of a 19th century American teacher to that of a 21st century one. The 19th century teachers present academic content to their students, but much of their role is to serve as a parental figure. This means the teachers prepare students for society by helping them develop moral maturity and helping them learn life skills. In the 21st century, the role of American teachers focuses on delivering academic content and less on practicing life skills. 
      
    </p>
    <p>
      
      I think this shift makes sense because the technological advancements have significantly changed the job market. Careers involving tasks that can be accomplished by automatons declined, and there is an increase in demand for professionals who can understand, operate, or create technology. This means more education is expected from employees of complex work. Although some may disagree, I believe it is the role of teachers to help prepare students for a career. Thus, schools evolved to be more academically rigorous to help students meet the expectations of a modern society. 
    </p>
    <p>
      While I appreciate the luxury brought by modern technology, I feel that there is still wisdom to be learned from the past. Even though much of the culture has changed over the past century and a half in Western society, I think maturity and life skills are always important for students to develop. A running remark among millennials is that students who finished high school or college undergrad can recall an academic detail they will not use in their potential career but do not know how to pay taxes. While the shift towards emphasizing academic rigor is expected, I think the decline of teaching practical life skills is unfortunate. 
      
    </p>
    <p>
      
      Even though they are both contemporary, Reddy’s experience at an American school is drastically different from Walker’s experience at a Finnish school. On Mader’s article, some readers may conclude that Reddy struggled greatly because he joined an alternative program instead of a traditional one. On the other hand, Finnish training programs are selective and require much more years to complete (Walker, 2016). The difference between the teacher training programs is great. However, I imagine first-year teachers with extensive training may still find teaching in an American school to be exhausting. Moreover, Walker—who has gone to an American college for his master’s degree instead of the longer and more selective Finnish training program—has not shown to be overwhelmed at the Finnish school. Although not explored directly in the articles, I think the significant differences between the schools in the United States and the schools in Finland is mainly due to the differences between the political attitudes towards education in those countries. Prior to reading these articles, I already often hear that education in the United States can learn a lot from the education in other countries. A common criticism is teachers in the United States are underpaid. High amount of work with relatively low rewards makes people more hesitant to become teachers in the United States. This means less teachers, which means more responsibilities for school faculties, and the cycle repeats. One can say that the role of a contemporary American teacher is that of an underappreciated exhausted worker. In contrast, the role of a contemporary Finnish teacher is that of a respected profession. 
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
    
      In short, there are strategies for improving the role of contemporary American teachers for the success of students’ learning. From the 19th century to the 21st century, the role of American teachers has become more focused on academic content and less on practical life skills. The increase in academic rigor makes sense, but the education of millennials is still criticized for not adequately preparing the generation for this decade’s job market. Instead of spending too much focus on learning content for the sake of learning, the role of teachers should be preparing students for society. In a sense, the 19th century teachers had the right idea. To help students meet the demands of this decade’s job market, I propose implementing practical classes such as computer programming and financial literacy into schools. Moreover, I believe improving the country’s political attitudes towards the role of teachers is integral to improving the role of teachers in American schools. More funding for schools means more teachers and more training for teachers. With more teachers and training, the teachers have manageable roles. When teachers can spare the time and energy to build positive relationships with students, students are more motivated to learn, and this makes teachers happier to teach. This way, the strength of American education can rise closer to that of Finland’s.
