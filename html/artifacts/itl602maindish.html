	<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p>
	<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>This is the document of the copyright and digital citizenship board game. The board game is intended to educate players on the topics of copyright law, fair use, copyright law and fair use in relation to new technologies and education, and the nine elements of digital citizenship. Following this introduction are: the instructions for the game; an index list that contains information on the topics of copyright, fair use, and digital citizenship; a personal analysis; and a reference list.</p>
	<p><strong>Game Instructions </strong></p>
	<p>Here is the instruction manual for the digital citizenship board game. The objects needed to play this are: the game board, player pieces, a six-sided dice, and this document. The game board is called a map and is filled with spots. Each player in the game is expected to bring a small object&mdash;the player piece-- that would represent the player. In the start of the game, all player pieces are placed on spot 0. Each player takes turns rolling the dice to make their piece travel on the map. The number on the dice determines how much the piece will travel.</p>
	<p>Each spot has a number labeled on it. This number is a key and each key corresponds to an item in the index list that shares the same number. When the player lands on a spot, the player has to refer to the index and read the item that shares the same number as the key. This is required to earn the points in the spot. Once all the points in the spot has been earned, the spot on the map becomes exhausted. Players cannot earn points by landing on exhausted spots. The game ends when all spots on the map are exhausted.</p>
	<p>Some spots contain more than one point. Players can agree on game rules regarding multiple points spots. An option is, when a player lands on a multi-points spot, that player earns all the points by reading the index item in one turn. Another option is: when a player lands on that spot, the player can only read a sub-index item and earn one point in one turn. For the same player to earn the rest of the points in the spot, the player has to roll dice to leave the spot and return to read a different sub-index item. However, another player may also enter the spot and earn a point by reading a sub-index item. The number on the star on the spots indicate the total points that can be earned from that spot.</p>

	<ol>
	<li>Definition of Copyright: "The legal right granted to an author, a composer, a playwright, a publisher, or a distributor to exclusive publication, production, sale, or distribution of a literary, musical, dramatic, or artistic work&rdquo; (Dictionary.com). 0 points.</li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong>Copyright Basics</strong></p>
	<ol>
	<li>"Copyright laws are based on the belief that anyone who creates an original, tangible work deserves to be compensated for that work, that compensation encourages more creative works, and that society as a whole benefits from the creative efforts of its members. Copyright laws, therefore, are designed to protect a creator's right to be compensated and to control how his or her work is used" (Starr, 2010). 1 pt.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;According to the law, copyrightable work must be tangible. A great joke told -- or a great song sung -- isn't protected by copyright until it's written down or recorded&rdquo; (Starr, 2010). 1 pt.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Copyrightable work must also be creative. Facts are not copyrightable -- although a clever collection of facts might be. Ideas are not copyrightable -- although a particular expression of an idea probably is&rdquo; (Starr, 2010). 1pt.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;All tangible creative works are protected by copyright immediately upon creation.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>An author does not have to register the work, announce that the work is copyright protected, or display the copyright symbol to enjoy copyright protection. All he or she must do is create an original work in tangible form&rdquo; (Starr, 2010). 1 pt.</p>
	<ol start="5">
	<li>&ldquo;Quoting or crediting the author of a copied work does not satisfy copyright requirements&rdquo; (Starr, 2010). 1 pt.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;When in doubt about either the copyright status of a work or the appropriateness of your use of that work, get permission?&rdquo; (Starr, 2010). 1 pt.</li>
	<li>What works are not copyrighted? Identify 4 groups.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Works that are not copyrighted:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>works that have not been fixed in a tangible form of expression.</li>
	<li>titles, names, short phrases, and slogans; familiar symbols or designs; mere variations of typographic ornamentation, lettering, or coloring; mere listings of ingredients or contents.</li>
	<li>ideas, procedures, methods, systems, processes, concepts, principles, discoveries, or devices -- as distinguished from a description, an explanation, or an illustration.</li>
	<li>works consisting entirely of information that is common property and contains no original authorship, such as standard calendars, height and weight charts, tape measures and rulers, and lists or tables taken from public documents or other common sources</li>
	</ul>
	<p>(U.S. Copyright Office). 4 pts.</p>
	<p><strong>Fair Use</strong></p>

	<p><strong>Teaching Responsibility </strong></p>
	<ol start="18">
	<li>&ldquo;Copyright law is designed to protect the financial interests of those who create original work; that financial rewards provide the incentive for the creation of more original works; and that obeying copyright laws benefits society by ensuring a steady supply of creative works&rdquo; (Starr, 2010). 1pt.</li>
	<li>Most of the materials people use are protected by copyright; the creator owns copyrighted work; and they have to ask permission to use it (Starr, 2010). 1pt.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Students should know how to find the owner of a copyrighted work and how to ask permission to use that work&rdquo; (Starr, 2010). 1pt.</li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong>The Nine Elements of Digital Citizenship </strong></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="21">
	<li>Digital Access: full electronic participation in society.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Not all users have the same opportunities in accessing technology. The goal is to expand access to technology for all digital citizens, and help ensure no one is denied digital access (Ribble, 2017). 1pt.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="22">
	<li>Digital Commerce: electronic buying and selling of goods.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>A large share of market economy is being done electronically. Internet purchases of almost all kinds of items are commonplace to many users. There are legal exchanges but there are also goods and services that conflict with laws. Users should learn how to be effective consumers (Ribble, 2017). 1pt.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="23">
	<li>Digital Communication: electronic exchange of information.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Communication technology has advanced significantly. That of today&rsquo;s is drastically different from that of two decades ago. &ldquo;Now everyone can communicate and collaborate with anyone from anywhere and anytime.&rdquo; Users should learn how to make appropriate decisions in the face of many different digital communication options (Ribble, 2017). 1pt. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="24">
	<li>Digital Literacy: process of teaching and learning about technology and the use of technology.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>New technologies such as videoconferencing are being implemented in the workplace. To be practical, schools should teach up-to-date technologies and how to use them. Various occupations require immediate information and searching and processing skills. Therefore, learners must be taught to learn anything, anytime, anywhere. &ldquo;As new technologies emerge, learners need to learn how to use that technology quickly and appropriately&rdquo; (Ribble, 2017). 1pt.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="25">
	<li>Digital Etiquette: electronic standards of conduct or procedure.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>&ldquo;Often rules and regulations are created or the technology is simply banned to stop inappropriate use. It is not enough to create rules and policy, we must teach everyone to become responsible digital citizens in this new society&rdquo; (Ribble, 2017). 1 pt.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="26">
	<li>Digital Law: electronic responsibility for actions and deeds</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Using technology to steal, cause damage to people&rsquo;s work, identity, or property online is crime and unethical use. Other unethical uses include hacking information, creating viruses, and sending spam (Ribble, 2017). 1 pt.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="27">
	<li>Digital Rights &amp; Responsibilities: those freedoms extended to everyone in a digital world.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>&ldquo;Digital citizens have the right to privacy, free speech, etc. Basic digital rights must be addressed, discussed, and understood in the digital world.&nbsp; With these rights also come responsibilities as well.&nbsp; Users must help define how the technology is to be used in an appropriate manner.&nbsp; In a digital society, these two areas must work together for everyone to be productive&rdquo; (Ribble, 2017). 1 pt.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="28">
	<li>Digital Health &amp; Wellness: physical and psychological well-being in a digital technology world.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Technology use is related to physical damages such as eye damage and poor posture. It is also related to psychological issues such as Internet addiction. &ldquo;Users need to be taught that there are inherent dangers of technology&rdquo; (Ribble, 2017). 1 pt.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="29">
	<li>Digital Security (self-protection): electronic precautions to guarantee safety.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Our work, information, property, and reputation have digital forms. There are people who steal from others or hurt the reputation of others in the digital community. &ldquo;We need to have virus protection, backups of data, and surge control of our equipment. As responsible citizens, we must protect our information from outside forces that might cause disruption or harm&rdquo; (Ribble, 2017). 1 pt.</p>

	<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
	<p>The purpose of this document is to state the instructions of the game, list the contents for the spots on the map, and list the references used. However, I also feel compelled to share my thoughts based on the research I have done in making this project. Linda Starr&rsquo;s The Educator&rsquo;s Guide to Copyright and Fair Use begins by stating that teachers who incorporate various media and resources into their lessons are probably &ldquo;terrific teachers&rdquo; but also &ldquo;copyright scofflaws&rdquo;. There are great educational resources in public and students deserve to have a great education. Following this logic, it makes sense for schools to utilize available resources to improve education. Denying educational materials to learners without a logical justification seem selfish and impractical.</p>
	<p>My understanding is that copyright laws are written to protect creators. Taking credit for another&rsquo;s work is unethical. Profiting from another&rsquo;s work without permission is unethical. These are reasonable concerns to me. However, it seems counterintuitive to me that content creators who share their content publicly would feel violated to learn that: people use the creators&rsquo; content for educational purposes and credit the authors. Perhaps creators who want their material to be shared should state that clearly, or in the vernacular of this topic, register it under public domain.</p>
