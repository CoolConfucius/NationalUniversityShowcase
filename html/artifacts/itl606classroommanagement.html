	<p>Dear Parents/ Guardians,</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve received this letter because your child/ children are enrolled in my Computer Science class. I am their teacher, Benjamin Huang, and I will do my best to make sure your children have a great learning experience. This letter includes: a brief description of four approaches to teaching relevant to classroom management; a rationale for my selected approach and how I will maintain it in my class; and a list of 15 rules with a brief statement of my rationale for each.</p>
	<p>The following are four approaches to teaching that are related to classroom management. The Behavioral approach defines learning in measurable behavioral terms, and uses reinforcers with individuals who exhibit desired social or academic responses. The Cognitive approach relies on the students&rsquo; ability to use reason to identify and assess their actions in school. In the Humanist approach, teachers are facilitators who encourage students to manage their own learning environment. The Social Psychological approach emphasizes the instruction and requirement of social skills to manage the learning environment (National University, 2018).</p>
	<p>All the approaches have their merits, but the one I have selected is the cognitive approach. The behavioral approach may risk conditioning students to excel socially and academically only when an immediate reward is given. The humanist approach seems to suggest minimal structure. Allowing students plenty of independence or freedom can be a great learning experience. However, structure gives students a sense of safety and the lack of structure can cause anxiety for some students. I know I personally thrive on having structure. The social psychological approach emphasizes social skills, which may make students on the autism spectrum or those who haven&rsquo;t developed strong social skills feel excluded. The cognitive approach helps promote student responsibility by guiding them to be mindful of their actions. This is explored in the next paragraph. In addition, I find this approach to be the most complementary to the Proactive Classroom Management strategy. This means I will structure my class in a way that minimizes misbehavior. I will have tasks for students with clear instructions, so students will have tasks to do and know how to do it (Sanford, 2017).</p>
	<p>I plan to teach and maintain the cognitive approach by implementing consequences for student actions. I will guide my students to use reason to identify and assess their actions in the classroom. They need to understand that the actions they take have consequences. My implementations of consequences are not simple punishments, but meant to promote student responsibility. When students arrive late to class for the first or second time, I will work with them to create solutions that help them get to class on time. Moreover, consequences I implement will be logical and related to the behavior. For example, the consequence for students who arrive to class late three times is that they have to make up for what they missed in class (Sanford, 2017).</p>
	<p>The following 15 rules are meant to make the learning environment consistent and structured, and thus safe for the students. This is analogous to having traffic lights for drivers (Sanford, 2017).</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Students should raise their hands and speak when called on.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>This is to keep order. When multiple students are speaking simultaneously, it is difficult to hear what is said and the volume can make the learning environment anxious.</p>
	<ol start="2">
	<li>Students entering the classroom should find their seats and work on the start-of-class activity. During class, transitions should be smooth: quick and quiet. While I&rsquo;m giving a lecture, or facilitating an in-class activity, the student entering the classroom should join in without disrupting. Students may get ready to exit when I&rsquo;ve given the instruction.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>I believe every second counts in learning. The smoother and less costly the transitions, then the more time and effort is devoted to learning.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="3">
	<li>Students should have required materials and supplies, such as books assigned to them and utensils for taking notes and keeping them organized.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The reason for students to have the necessary items ready is so that they can participate in learning.</p>
	<ol start="4">
	<li>When using classroom devices, use with care and return them after use.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>In a Computer Science class, computers in the classroom are expected. Students are free to either bring their own devices or use the classroom devices. The classroom devices are shared learning tools. Making the devices unusable would be unfair to others who may want to use them.</p>
	<ol start="5">
	<li>When students need to use the restroom, they will raise a hand with two fingers, then I will respond by giving thumbs up. At this signal, the student is free to leave the classroom, but is expected to return in a reasonable time frame.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The reason for this hand gesture is efficiency. This way, students do not have to ask for permission while competing with students asking questions related to the content.</p>
	<ol start="6">
	<li>During a lecture or in-class activity, students should not be talking about topics unrelated to class. Talks productive to learning should be at a reasonable volume.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>This is because I want the learning environment geared towards learning. When students are talking off topic, they are not focused on the lecture or class activity. However, I encourage students to talk to one another if it helps with their learning. English Learners may benefit greatly from a friend explaining terms to them. I just ask the talk to be at a reasonable volume so it doesn&rsquo;t distract other students too much.</p>
	<ol start="7">
	<li>Only water is allowed in my class.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Whether a snack or a full meal, the students eating have given their attention to their food and away from the class activity. Moreover, the smells of the food and the sounds of students eating will likely distract the rest of the students. Furthermore, bringing food into the classroom increases the likelihood of creating a mess, making the learning environment unpleasant.</p>
	<ol start="8">
	<li>Students should not bring distracting items such as video games in class.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The items they bring should help make the learning environment productive, not dangerous. Before leaving class, students should collect their personal items and not leave them in the classroom. I myself will refrain from brining distracting items into the classroom.</p>
	<ol start="9">
	<li>Students should follow my directions.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The directions I give in class serve to optimize students&rsquo; learning, so they should attend to directions not simply because I am their teacher, but because it is for their learning. There may be exceptions. If students are not able to follow some directions without experiencing great anxiety due to a medical or special need, then they exempt. I will do my best to accommodate should the need arises. However, I will be very mindful in giving directions that every student can reasonably follow.</p>
	<ol start="10">
	<li>Students should address me as Mr. Huang and use courteous verbal and body language.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>This is because I want to establish effective teacher-student relationships with my students. If students see me as a friend, they may not respect me as a teacher and this hurts the students&rsquo; learning.</p>
	<ol start="11">
	<li>Be present in class.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Class time is devoted to learning and absences mean missing out on learning. I understand if students have a medical or personal reason to be absent. In these cases, they should notify me in advance if possible.</p>
	<ol start="12">
	<li>Complete assignments on time.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Their assignments are used to help me track their learning progress and lets me know if they need extra help on the subject. A missing assignment means a missing grade. There are exceptions. If students have a medical reason or have major personal commitments, then they may request an extension for the assignment. They should notify me in advance if possible.</p>
	<ol start="13">
	<li>Treat members of the learning community with respect.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>A respectful atmosphere is conducive to learning.</p>
	<ol start="14">
	<li>No harassment.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>I want the learning environment to be safe. I will meet with students who speak unkind words to their peers. I will tell them how harmful their behavior is and ask them to apologize. The message I want to give is: harassment is not okay. If the students&rsquo; harassment in class is extreme or frequent, then I will take further disciplinary action: bringing the issue to parents or other school faculty.</p>
	<ol start="15">
	<li>Students should notify me of health issues that may interfere with class.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>This way, I can accommodate them more effectively and think of ways to minimize potential disruption. This also helps me know that the medication they bring is safe.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>I will discuss these rules with my students. To begin, I will tell them why rules in the classroom are necessary. After all, adults in public or professional environments follow regulations. This helps make society safer. Likewise, I want our learning environment to be safe. I may ask my students to create a list of rules they would like to see in the classroom (Sanford, 2017).</p>
