	<p><strong>Section 1</strong></p>
	<p>Piaget's Cognitive Development Theory states that children go through the following four stages: Sensorimotor, Preoperational, Concrete Operational, and Formal Operational. Slavin's text describes these stages in depth (Slavin, 2018, 26). Vygotsky&rsquo;s theory suggest that cognitive development is dependent on signs, input from others. The theory includes concepts such as private speech, the zone of proximal development, mediation, scaffolding, and cooperative learning. Slavin's text describes these concepts in depth on page 26 (Slavin, 2018). Kohlberg&rsquo;s Stages of Moral Reasoning theorizes that people go through three levels: Preconventional, Conventional, and Postconventional. Slavin&rsquo;s text summarizes the levels on page 49 (Slavin, 2018).</p>
	<p>Piaget&rsquo;s theory and Vygotsky&rsquo;s theory are similar in that they both describe cognitive development, how children think, learn, and solve problems. The theories are different in that, in Piaget&rsquo;s theory, development proceeds learning, while in Vygotsky&rsquo;s theory, learning proceeds development. (Slavin, 2018, 33). In Piaget&rsquo;s theory, children&rsquo;s cognitive abilities depend on which stage they are in. In Vygotsky&rsquo;s theory, children&rsquo;s cognitive abilities depend on their experiences with inputs such as interactions with adults.</p>
	<p>Kohlberg&rsquo;s Moral Development Theory is similar to Piaget&rsquo;s Cognitive and Moral Development Theory in the sense that they describe developmental stages in children. Kohlberg&rsquo;s theory differs from Piaget&rsquo;s Cognitive theory and Vygotsky&rsquo;s theory in the sense that the reasoning in Kohlberg&rsquo;s theory is applied to the moral aspect while the logic in Piaget&rsquo;s Cognitive theory and Vygotsky&rsquo;s theory are applied to problem solving.</p>
	<p><strong>Section 2 </strong></p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All three theories can be applied in the school or classroom. While Piaget&rsquo;s theory is very influential, research on children has yielded results that conflict with the stages of development. Slavin&rsquo;s text describes this on page 31 (Slavin, 2018).&nbsp; I select Vygotsky&rsquo;s theory because I can envision the concepts applied to teaching Computer Science or Mathematics more directly.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Private Speech: &ldquo;children incorporate the speech of others and then use that speech to help themselves solve problems&rdquo; (Slavin, 2018). Talking out loud to solve problems is expected in coding interviews for software developer. I may conduct activities where students solve difficult coding or math problems. If they are stuck, I may encourage them to talk out the problem-solving process.</p>
	<p>The Zone of Proximal Development: &ldquo;learning takes place most effectively when children are working within their zone of proximal development&rdquo; (Slavin, 2018). Before teaching students relatively advanced coding concepts such as recursive functions, teachers should make sure students are first comfortable with preceding concepts such as loops and simple functions.</p>
	<p>Mediation: &ldquo;older children and adults help learners by explaining, modeling, or breaking down complex skills, knowledge, or concepts&rdquo; (Slavin, 2018). Teaching coding or math by demonstrating examples of solving problems is effective in helping students learn.</p>
	<p>Scaffolding: &ldquo;providing a child with a great deal of support during the early stages of learning and then diminishing that support and having the child take on increasing responsibility as soon as she or he is able&rdquo; (Slavin, 2018). In math, it would make sense for me to first guide my students in solving problems. I may first model solving problems, then have students solve problems along with me, then have students solve problems with my guidance, and eventually, have students solve problems independently.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cooperative Learning: &ldquo;the use of cooperative learning strategies in which children work together to help one another learn&hellip; cooperative learning makes children&rsquo;s inner speech available to others, so they can gain insight into one another&rsquo;s reasoning process&rdquo; (Slavin, 2018). Software developers work in teams. Therefore, it is practical for me to assign group projects or conduct activities where students have the opportunity to work together to solve a problem.</p>
	<p><strong>Section 3 </strong></p>
	<p>Less than three weeks ago, I observed two periods of a social skills class for autistic students. Although the students are close to one another in age, they seem to be at different levels in terms of social skills. The teachers discussed with the students on how to make conversation. They conducted an activity called Park Bench. In this activity, two students are selected and each is assigned a role&mdash;an emotion and reason for the emotion. The two selected students will have a conversation that demonstrates their role to the audience without giving it away explicitly. The watching students are supposed to pay attention, notice the word choices, tone, and body language to figure out the roles of the students having the conversation. Some students were articulate and others struggled to speak. Yet, the teachers still gave praise and feedback to the students. To students who whisper or appear neutral, the teachers told them to speak louder or with more emotion. To the student who was cartoonish dramatic, a teacher told him to tone down. To students who were articulate, teachers told him to consider incorporating subtle tweaks in speech and body language to enhance communication.</p>
	<p><strong>Section 4 </strong></p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this example, I see the concepts of Vygotsky&rsquo;s theory at play. The Zone of Proximal Development is relevant here. Social skills are a wide spectrum from elementary to advanced. The social skills taught in the class should be rudimentary to most adults, but that is because they are targeted at autistic students. When students are struggling with basic social skills, then they are unlikely to comprehend advanced social skills. The teachers used examples and explained concepts so Mediation is applied. For example, the teachers explained how to end a conversation without making it awkward. I saw Scaffolding when some students are hesitant to speak and the teachers encourage them to speak. Some students became silent in a conversation. The teachers then told them to ask questions to keep the conversation going. The Park Bench activity is an example of Cooperative Learning. The two students in the conversation were helping each other learn. During the students&rsquo; analysis discussion after the conversation, they share their insights, helping one another learn.</p>
