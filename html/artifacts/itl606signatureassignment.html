	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Behavioral models emphasize behavior changes according to pleasurable or</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unpleasurable consequences, while Social models, although similar, emphasize</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; learning through observation and modeling (Slavin, 2018, p. 101). Both behavioral</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and social learning models deal with what can be observed. A Behavioral</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approach uses reinforcers to shape behavior and guide learning, while a Social</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approach uses social skills and cooperative learning styles (National University,</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2018).</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Cognitive or Information Processing models, the focus is on</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unobservable mental processes one goes through to learn and remember new</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information and skills (Slavin, 2018, p. 97). It relies on a student&rsquo;s ability to</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reason (National University, 2018). Humanistic or Personal Family Models</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; emphasize helping students guide their own learning with teacher as a more of</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a guide using non-directive teaching styles (National University, 2018).</p>

	<ol>
	<li>Given the data provided about Ray, which you summarized in the table in the first prompt, which of the 4 family models of teaching would you primarily draw upon for Ray&rsquo;s instruction? Why did you select this model? Why did you not select the other models?&nbsp; Support your ideas with citations from your text, Class Packet, and from other videos and lectures for SPD 604.&nbsp; Be sure to select only from the Models of Teaching introduced in the PowerPoints.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most effective approach to use with Ray would be a Cognitive or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information Processing Model. Ray already exhibits a need to know and</p>
	<p class="blue"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;understand, which is a growth need according to Maslow&rsquo;s Hierarchy of Needs</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Slavin, 2018, p.250). He would benefit from direct instruction from the teacher</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with emphasis placed on cognitive strategies for getting short term memories into</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long term memories (Slavin, 2018, p. 121). His head injury could have affected his</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ability to remember, and he may need more help with information processing.</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although a Humanistic Approach focuses on building self-esteem, Ray&rsquo;s low</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self-efficacy is mainly in his academic ability, and not in other areas of his life.</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, he is very confident in his ability to fix up motorcycles. This approach</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also uses a non-directive teaching strategy, which may not be a good fit for Ray.</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Social Approach uses cooperative learning, which may create an uncomfortable</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; learning environment for Ray since he is very quiet and does not socialize much. Ray</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is already well behaved and motivated to learn, and does not need reinforcers to</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; encourage him.</p>

	<p>Once you have selected a model of teaching, read about and then discuss with your work group, the various teaching methodologies presented within this model that might be effective for Ray. Now come to consensus and select the one you think is the BEST for Ray. (Be Sure the methodology you select is from the Model of Teaching you noted in the previous response.)&nbsp; Which methodology would you select? Why? Why did you not select other methodologies from this model? Support your ideas with citations from your text, Class Packet, and from other videos and lectures for ITL 606, and other sources you identify.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">Under the Information Processing Model, Ray may do well with the Advance Organizers. In this method a teacher can use study guides that specifically go along with the lessons with fill-in-the-blanks to help Ray learn unknown words (National University, 2018). The process of writing the words can help it stick into his long term memory. There are also picture icons that could be used to make it easier for him. This may help Ray with learning math, and he can review his notes for homework and testing. By building smaller pieces and focus, it is more likely that Ray&rsquo;s self-confidence will increase and show in his work. The reasons for not choosing the other methodologies is because he still struggles with learning English. Advance Organizers are actually shown to be effective for English Learners (National University, 2018).</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="4">
	<li>Objectives: Identify both social and academic goals for Ray. Given that we want students to improve in their area of need and that we also structure our teaching around state standards, analyze the needs of the student, Ray. (Maximum 150 words). Examine the content of the column from Step 1 above, under &ldquo;Needs&rdquo;. Discuss with your work group, come to consensus and select one item from the &ldquo;needs&rdquo; you believe to be most important for improving student social behavior. Identify that need. Based on this identified NEED, write one thing you want Ray to know or be able to do that he did not know or was not able to do before your instruction, related to his social behavior. Examine the column from Step 1 above, under &ldquo;Needs&rdquo;. Discuss, come to consensus and select another one of the &ldquo;needs&rdquo; you believe to be the most important for improving academic acquisition. Identify that need. Based on this identified NEED, write one thing you want Ray to know or be able to do that he did not know or was not able to do before your instruction, related to academics for algebra and identified in the Common Core Standards, that would be relevant and essential. Think of each of these two as being informal learning objectives.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>List each informal learning objective and tell why you selected it.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>As far as improving social behavior, Ray has a need to make friends. As an informal learning objective the teacher could give him the goal of making at least one friend in class. The teacher could have him choose a partner to work with during math. By taking the time to talk with a fellow classmate Ray would also be improving his English, and it may also help raise his self-esteem.</p>
	<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
	<p class="blue"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>As far as an academic goal, Ray could work on improving his math skills. To align with a Common Core Standard, (1.1) &ldquo;Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them&rdquo; could be an informal learning objective to work on (Slavin, 2018, p. 403). This would help develop his cognitive abilities and in the process give him confidence and pride.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="5">
	<li>Assessment &amp; Evaluation: Apply assessment knowledge. For each informal learning objective you identified in #4 above for Ray, how would you determine if that objective was achieved or not? In other words, for each objective, what type of assessment measurement(s) would you employ to determine if your objective was met?</li>
	</ol>
	<p>(Maximum 150 words).</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The informal learning objective of making one friend, and specifically learning to work with a partner in math could be assessed and evaluated through direct observation while walking around. To get Ray&rsquo;s perspective, one could ask him specifically how he is getting along with his partner.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The informal learning objective of improving math skills, and specifically making sense of problems and persevering can be assessed and evaluated in two ways. As a formative assessment, Mr. Jones can ask Ray questions orally that he could eventually answer without saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;. Perhaps setting a goal of answering fifty percent of the time. As a summative assessment, Mr. Jones can continue to give Ray and the rest of the class tests at the end of the units. He could give credit to all questions he attempts to answer regardless of whether it is right or wrong.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="6">
	<li>Classroom management: Apply classroom management knowledge. Think about the class as a whole. Based on the strengths, needs, interests and preferred ways of learning of the class, Mr. Jones&rsquo; information about his class, and what you have studied regarding classroom management, identify 3-5 ideas you would implement to improve Mr. Jones&rsquo; classroom management, and provide a valid rationale for each.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>(Maximum 300 words)</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The most effective approach to classroom management is effective instruction&rdquo; (Slavin, 2018, p. 272). Mr. Jones could incorporate the interests of his students into the math lessons to make it more engaging for them. For instance, solving algebraic word problems based on folklorico dancing, motorcycles, space, fashion, animation, computers, various countries, or he might have them each do a project based on their interests while demonstrating their math skills. Since most of the students are visual learners, Mr. Jones could make sure he draws pictures and diagrams in order to get the meaning of concepts across, even using multiple colors of highlighters on the board.</p>
	<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
	<p class="blue"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Another approach to classroom management that Mr. Jones could use is creating classroom rules with the students&rsquo; input. Students will be much more invested in their class when they have a say on how it is run (Sanford, 2017). To make the rules meaningful, Mr. Jones should implement consequences students&rsquo; actions. These are not meant as simple punishments, but meant to promote responsibility in students. The consequence should be logical and related to the behavior (Sanford, 2017).</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">Structure in the class gives students a sense of safety and the lack of structure can cause anxiety for some students. Many students misbehave because they do not know what they are supposed to do. Mr. Jones can give tasks for students with clear instructions, so students will have tasks to do and know how to do it. This minimizes misbehavior among students (Sanford, 2017).</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jones could also use cooperative learning to help manage the classroom environment. Pairing up stronger students with those struggling with their math skills may be beneficial.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="7">
	<li>Communication: Apply knowledge of collaboration.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>When teachers have concerns about students and want to improve the interventions they implement, it is important to include relevant individuals in the discussion and planning. For this case study, with which individuals would you want to conference, in relation to Ray, as you are</p>
	<p>planning, and why would you want to conference with each? Provide a rationale for each.</p>
	<p>(Maximum 150 words)</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>It would be beneficial to open up further communication with Ray&rsquo;s other teachers, his Case Manager in Special Education, his ELL Teacher (if he has one), and his parents/family. Mr. Jones needs to talk further with Ray&rsquo;s other teachers to find out how he gets along in other classes. Does he have friends? Does he volunteer answers or contribute in their classes? Does he get frustrated in other classes? What causes him to lose his temper? What strengths do you see in him? These are all good questions to ask in order to provide the kind of support Ray needs. In the case of his Case Manager in Special Education, a good question would be to see if he could get a copy of Ray&rsquo;s IEP, specifically his goals. It is important for all of the support team for Ray help him to work toward these goals. As far as the Intermediate rating on his CELDT, Ray would need to achieve Early Advanced in order to be considered Fluent English Proficient. It would be a good idea to find out what EL classes he is taking and talk to that teacher in order to best support him in learning English. Lastly, and most importantly, Mr. Jones needs to communicate with Ray&rsquo;s parents and family members. If they only know Spanish then he should get an interpreter. His parents know him best. Ray should be included in the meeting; he might have a lot to say. After all, Ray could tell him how much he really wants to learn and understand, what his interests are, and how he feels about himself. This would give Mr. Jones a considerable amount of information in which to implement a teaching strategy that works best for Ray. It takes a whole team to be successful in helping a child grow to their full potential.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="8">
	<li>Parent notification: Demonstrate understanding and consideration.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Parent perspective and feelings should be considered when we communicate and in making decisions. Parents of children in special education may be cycling through grief at the loss of the child they had or had dreamed about. Parents need to be kept informed of progress and needs of their child, and about plans to address concerns.</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Given Ray&rsquo;s brain damage, what feelings might his parents be experiencing? Why do you think so? What considerations should be given to the parent(s)&rsquo; / guardians&rsquo; perspective and feelings? (Maximum 75 words)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">Ray&rsquo;s parents could be experiencing self blame or depression, and/or struggling to accept. They would most likely be past the denial stage considering he has been identified as needing Special Services and has an IEP. One has to put themselves into the shoes of the parents and realize what it would feel like to know your child may never be the same after a head injury. There may be a lot of guilt associated with this. Mr. Jones should be empathetic and patient with them.</p>
	<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
	<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
	<ol>
	<li>When, when and why would you communicate with Ray&rsquo;s parent(s)? (Maximum 150 words)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">Mr. Jones should communicate with Ray&rsquo;s parents as soon as possible. They may be hesitant or extremely busy, however an effort should be made to sit down and meet with them. It is important to break down any barriers there may be to collaborating. Possible barriers may include: a lack of information or misinformation from both parties, different expectations, a lack of understanding of the teacher&rsquo;s role or of the family&rsquo;s life, and different communication styles or language (National University, 2018). For the sake of Ray&rsquo;s well being and future, every attempt at collaborating should be made.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Identify multiple ways you would communicate with Ray&rsquo;s parent(s). (Maximum 50 words)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">Mr. Jones can meet with Ray&rsquo;s parents in person either at school or a home visit, through email, or phone calls. If Spanish is a language barrier for them, Mr. Jones can make sure there is an Interpreter there or have his emails translated into Spanish. He should make sure to keep in touch on a regular basis, especially with good news.</p>

	<p><strong>Part II</strong></p>
	<p><strong>The Other Six Students</strong></p>
	<p>Review and discuss with your group the Profile of Mr. Jones and the additional six student profiles provided for his class. Then respond to the questions about each of the six students. Discuss the following questions within your work group and come to consensus on one response to each question.</p>
	<p>**Please note: for each student you are asked &ldquo;If you were to have ______ work with a partner, whom would you select and why?&rdquo; If you identify one of the other six students for whom you have a profile, be sure to make the choice reciprocal. In other words, if you identify Marta as the person to work with Steven, then also identify Steven as the person to work with Marta, for example, and identify how each would be helpful to the other.</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Given the Needs identified for Marta, which need to do think should be addressed first by Mr. Jones? Why do you think so? (Maximum 75 words)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">Mr. Jones should address Marta&rsquo;s need as an English Learner first because all her other needs stem from this need. She has trouble following directions not because she does not want to, but because she struggles with understanding English. She does not speak when called on because she is embarrassed about the way she speaks English. She talks to Aracely in class because she has trouble with the English terms used and is getting help from Aracely.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Which teaching Model and Methodology would most help Marta with this need within Mr. Jones&rsquo; class? What is your rationale for this answer? (Use citations to support your answer.) (Maximum 75 words)</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">A Social Model or Methodology that allows students to learn cooperatively would most help Marta with this need within Mr. Jones&rsquo;s class. The rationale is: Marta and Aracely have been working together and their cooperative learning has produced good results as shown in their assignments. Aracely helps Marta understand English terms, and Marta helps Aracely with Algebra. Moreover, the professional environment heavily relies on cooperation. Students capable of cooperating with others should have the opportunities to exercise this skill to prepare for life after school (Johnson &amp; Johnson).</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>If you were to have Marta work with a partner, who would you select and why? (Maximum 50 words)</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">We would select Aracely because they are experienced in working together. If it must be one of the six students, then we would select Rukhsana because she is fluent in English and could use Marta&rsquo;s help with Math. Ray could also be a choice because they can relate as English learners.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="2">
	<li>Given Dillon&rsquo;s interests in computers, how could Mr. Jones incorporate Dillon&rsquo;s interests in computers into his instructional plan for the class? Why do you think so? <em>(Maximum 50 words)</em></li>
	</ol>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">If Dillon, and Mr. Jones, know how to code, Mr. Jones can give Dillon the option of alternative assignments. Algebra and programming are compatible. They are both about problem solving and share concepts such as variables, functions, inputs, and outputs. In these assignments, Dillon can code functions that accept conditions of algebra problems as inputs and output the solutions to those problems.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>If you were to have Dillon work with a partner, who would you select and why? <em>(Maximum 50 words)</em></p>
	<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
	<p class="blue">We would select Steven or Bill. If Dillon isn&rsquo;t one of the students who is cruel to Steven, then Steven may be a good selection. Steven loves astronomy, a field that involves cutting-edge technology. He reads updates on NASA, sees Stephen Hawking as his hero, and is good with computers. Bill would be a safe choice. Both Dillon and Bill do well academically, socially, and both have good relationships with their families.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="3">
	<li>Given that one of the Strengths identified for Bill is that he is social and makes friends easily, how could Mr. Jones capitalize on this to support others in the class? What is your rationale? <em>(Maximum 75 words)</em></li>
	</ol>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">Bill&rsquo;s social strength suggests that Bill is suited for leadership roles. To capitalize on this to support others in the class, Mr. Jones can assign Bill a role where he can lead or facilitate other students in their learning. This also works because Bill excels at Math.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>If you were to utilize one of Bill&rsquo;s strengths to help others in the class, do you think this would have a negative impact on Bill? What is your rationale for your statement?<em>(Maximum 75 words)</em></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">It is possible that Bill may see this as an unfair burden. He may feel that he is doing work that other students should be doing in addition to his own work. On the other hand, Bill may appreciate this role and see it as a worthy achievement.&nbsp; He may like the fact that he is needed, or wanted, in this special role.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>If you were to have Bill work with a partner, who would you select and why? <em>(Maximum 50 words)</em></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">Dillon may be a safe choice. Both Dillon and Bill do well academically, socially, and both have good relationships with their families. They also learn in similar ways through Kinesthetic and Visual ways. This would provide a good way to learn, collaborate, and teach each other the lesson.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="4">
	<li>What must Mr. Jones do, now that one of the students has told him Gina is being molested by her mother&rsquo;s boyfriend? When should he do this? Why?</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Identify at least 2 things that would likely happen if he does not do this? <em>(Maximum 75 words)</em></p>
	<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
	<p class="blue">Mr. Jones is required by law to be a Mandated Reporter. He must do this immediately. He has to call and fill out paperwork for either Child Protective Services (CPS) or the Police Department.</p>
	<p class="blue">Gina&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s boyfriend will continue to molest Gina if no action is taken to stop it. Gina would likely develop mental health problems that can lead to thoughts of self-harm or worse. Her grades would likely suffer and drop from the stress caused by her mother&rsquo;s boyfriend.</p>
	<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
	<p>Do you think Gina&rsquo;s molest has any impact on her attitude? Discuss. <em>(Maximum 125 words)</em></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">Yes. In the second case study file, Gina expresses a negative view towards boys and men. It is likely that the experience of her mother&rsquo;s boyfriend molesting her impacted this. This attitude affects all aspects of life in which people who present as male are involved. Her meanness towards Steven may be a manifestation of this attitude. Steven is an easy target because he cannot retaliate. Gina may feel the need for this kind of empowerment to counter the disempowering dynamic she has with her mother&rsquo;s boyfriend. Steven aside, she may work poorly with boys and have less respect for Mr. Jones. She does not struggle with learning the way some other students do, but it is possible that this attitude holds back some level of her potential.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>If you were to have Gina work with a partner, who would you select and why? <em>(Maximum 50 words)</em></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">The friend Gina confided in would be a good choice because there is trust between them. This is a difficult one if it has to be one of the six. It is known that Gina is mean to Steven, and she has a negative view on boys. Of the six students, it&rsquo;ll have to be either Marta or Rukhsana. If we had to choose, Rukhsana may be a better choice because she can communicate with her better than an English learner.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="5">
	<li>What are some of the experiences that set Rukhsana apart from others in the class? How do you think they set her apart? How might these experiences be ameliorated in Mr. Jones&rsquo; class? <em>(Maximum 150 words)</em></li>
	</ol>
	<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
	<p class="blue">Rukhsana comes from a country where turmoil and persecution has ravaged her life. She has also witnessed a lot of violence that other students in the class have not, like seeing her cousin die from a bomb blast. She has probably done a lot of quick growing up in situations back in Greece. Mr. Jones can provide encouraging, positive, and lively scenarios in his math class to keep Rukhsana focused on the good.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Which teaching Model and Methodology would most ameliorate the effects of Rukhsana&rsquo;s experiences? What is your rationale for this answer?</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">A Social teaching Model or Methodology would most ameliorate the effects of Rukhsana&rsquo;s experiences. The rationale is: working with a partner or group not only helps with learning, but may also build a sense of community or learning, which can ameliorate trauma.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Would this type of instruction be inappropriate for other students in the class? Why? (Use citations to support your answer.) <em>(Maximum 75 words)</em></p>
	<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
	<p class="blue">This type of instruction might be inappropriate for other students in the class. Students known to bully their peers can use this opportunity to pick on their classmates when the teacher is not paying attention or is passive about managing the class. Students with a history of being victimized by others may feel great anxiety. Students possessing a level of social skills is expected for cooperative learning to be effective. Students on the autism spectrum or students who have not developed decent social skills may feel excluded. Of course, students lacking social skills can and should develop social skills. However, Mr. Jones may not have the expertise or responsibility to teach social skills in his Algebra class (Johnson &amp; Johnson).</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
	<p>If you were to have Rukhsana work with a partner, who would you select and why? <em>(Maximum 50 words)</em></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">Heather would be a safe choice because they are best friends. If it has to be one of the six, Marta would be a suitable partner&nbsp; because they would complement each other well. Marta can help Rukhsana with Math while Rukhsana can help Marta with English.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol start="6">
	<li>Given the Needs identified for Steven, which need to do think should be addressed first by Mr. Jones? Why do you think so? How does this relate to Steven&rsquo;s IEP? <em>(Maximum 150 words)</em></li>
	</ol>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">Mr. Jones should first address the need to build a safe learning environment for Steven. Cruel behavior from peers, unaddressed, not only damages Steven&rsquo;s learning experiences, but also sends the message that such behavior is tolerated in school. Pushed far, Steven may associate school with being victimized, and by extension, associate learning with trauma. Steven has an IEP goal of making and keeping friends. Unaddressed bullying behavior likely causes Steven to be anxious or fearful around peers, an obstacle to that IEP goal.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">In the third case study file, Mr. Jones thought Steven should stay in his special education class because it takes longer for him to ask questions and give answers in class. However, Steven&rsquo;s parents and special education teacher say he is too academically and intellectually advanced. Placing Steven at the right academic level is important, but creating a supportive enough learning environment is a higher priority.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Which teaching Model and Methodology would most help Steven with this need, within Mr. Jones&rsquo; class? What is your rationale for this answer?</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">Steven would benefit from a social teaching model and methodology because that forces students to work in a group and build a sense of community.&nbsp; Although forcing students to work together is not always beneficial, this could help the students communicate with Steven a bit better.&nbsp; With Mr. Jones&rsquo; close watch and facilitation, he can create a positive learning environment for Steven.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Would this type of instruction be inappropriate for other students in the class? Why? (Use citations to support your answer.) <em>(Maximum 75 words)</em></p>
	<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
	<p class="blue">This would not be inappropriate for other students in the class because working cooperatively and in groups does not offend or hurt anyone. It is crucial that students in Mr. Jones&rsquo; class learn to communicate and understand each other. Cooperative learning model&rsquo;s goal is to promote interaction, and create positive outcomes called positive interdependence (Slavin, 2018).</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>If you were to have Steven work with a partner, who would you select and why? <em>(Maximum 50 words)</em></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">More information is needed on which students are known to mock Steven. Gina is ruled out because she is mean to Steven. We would select one that is known to be polite or patient. Ray may be a good choice. Temper aside, he is polite and respectful. Although different from Steven&rsquo;s, Ray can relate to having special, specific needs.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Part III<br /> The Class as a Whole</strong></p>
	<p><br /> In this final section you and your partners will consider the class as a whole, given the information you have been provided.<br /> 1. You have been asked to read and learn about Universal Design for Learning. The three basic principles focus on multiple means of (a) representation, (b) expression, and (c) engagement. Discuss with your partners.<br /> <br /> Write a brief persuasive paragraph advocating for the adoption and use of the principles of Universal Design for Learning. (Maximum 150 words)</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="blue">Universal Designs for learning gives all students access to the curriculum by reducing the barriers. UDL meets state standards, allows flexibility, and is set up to support the needs, strengths, interests, and preferred ways of learning for a range of diverse learners (Ralabate, 2018). It gives all students equal opportunity to succeed, including learners with disabilities (Morin, 2018). This is ideal for Mr. Jones&rsquo;s class of diverse learners where he can use various methods of presenting lessons, allow a variety of ways for students to express what they know, and keep them engaged using multiple means of motivation.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><br /> Write a brief persuasive paragraph advocating against the adoption and use of the principles of Universal Design for Learning. (Maximum 150 words)</p>
	<p class="blue">Universal Design for Learning is geared toward helping all students in the classroom succeeding by specific adaptations.&nbsp; It gets harder to adapt UDL in the classroom as class sizes increase, and more variety of needs are presented.&nbsp; UDL would not only create stress to the teacher in providing for all, but could possibly create suffering and hardship in the students&rsquo; success. A well thought out teaching style may be effective for eighty percent of the students in a relatively large class. An attempt to make learning optimal for the other twenty percent will likely run the risk of the other students losing motivation, patience, or clarity on the class material. Instead of developing a &ldquo;one-size-fits-all&rdquo; teaching style, it may be more effective to teach in a way that is effective for the majority while spending time supporting individuals who need additional attention.</p>
	<ol start="2">

Identify ways you could structure multiple means of (a) representation, (b) expression, and (c) engagement within each model / methodology. Fill in the table. (next page) Be specific. For example, for a means of representation don&rsquo;t write &ldquo;provide visuals&rdquo; instead write &ldquo;diagram the process on the smart board&rdquo;.</li>
