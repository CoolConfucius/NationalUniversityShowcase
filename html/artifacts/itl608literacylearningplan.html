		This document is a model learning plan for Mr. Jones’ middle school Algebra class. It focuses on a Common Core literacy standard in mathematics. The learning plan also addresses the 6 instructional elements of the Learning Map Planning Stage and UDL in terms of Engagement, Representation, and Expression. A means for assessing student learning outcomes aligned to the learning plan’s targets is also included. 
	</p>

	<h4>Learners:</h4>
	<p>
		Ray and Marta both need help with English Fluency, plus Ray has trouble hearing. To consider their needs, Mr. Jones needs to make sure to face the class when he speaks, repeat important instruction, and go over Algebraic vocabulary in detail. He can say it and write it on the whiteboard. Ray and Marta could also benefit with having an advanced organizer for the lesson with fill in the blanks for vocabulary words.
	</p>
	<p>
		
		He should include students’ interests in the lesson:  motorcycles, folklorico dancing, fashion, astronomy, Stephen Hawking, countries of the world, and animation.
	</p>
	<p>
		
		Ray had an accident and wears a hearing aid. He doesn’t interact with other students and doesn’t ask for help. He learns best when work is demonstrated to him. Otherwise, he struggles. Language is also an obstacle for him. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Marta does not speak when called on because she is embarrassed about speaking English. She talks to Aracely in class to get help understanding the terms. Marta and Aracely’s homework look similar because Marta helps Aracely. 
		
	</p>
	<p>
		
		Dillon and Bill are doing well academically and socially, and both have good relationships with their families. Dillon is interested in technology and animation. Bill wants to join the Navy SEALS. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Gina has a hostile attitude towards men and boys. One of her mother’s boyfriends is sexually molesting her. She has confided this to a friend. 
		
	</p>
	<p>
		
		Rukhsana is making a sincere effort in class, but still struggles with her math skills. She has an intense refugee family background and history. She saw a cousin die from an explosion. Her best friend in class is Heather. 
	</p>
	<p>
		
		Steven has Cerebral Palsy, uses a wheelchair and devices to communicate, and is accompanied by a paraprofessional. Although Mr. Jones consider him slow and needy, Steven is an intelligent fast learner. He has a strong interest in astronomy and looks up to Stephen Hawking. There are peers who mistreat him and mock him for his condition. He could use friends. 
	</p>
	<p>
		
		The following information on learning styles tells Mr. Jones he should make sure to have visual and kinesthetic presentations of the lesson material for his students.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			
			Visual learners:  Ray, Marta, Dillon, Bill, Gina, Rukhsana, and Steven
		</li>
		<li>
			
			Kinesthetic:  Ray, Dillon, Bill, Gina
		</li>
		<li>
			
			Auditory:  Dillon, Rukhsana          
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>
		
		Teacher
	</h4>
	<p>
		We don’t know very much about Mr. Jones, other than the fact that he is a 7th-8th grade algebra teacher in California's Central Valley. We know nothing of his funds of knowledge, his disposition, his guiding tenets, or his curricular approaches. We do know that he wants all of his students to be successful in his class and that he is willing to go the extra mile to make it happen.
		
	</p>
	<h4>
		
		Target 
	</h4>
	<p>
		
		CCSS 7  Solve real-life and mathematical problems using numerical and algebraic expressions  and equations.
	</p>
	<p>
		CCSS 7.EE.B.4  Use variables to represent quantities in a real-world or mathematical problem,  and construct simple equations and inequalities to solve problems by reasoning.
		
	</p>
	<p>
		<u>
			Learning Objective based on the Standard: 	
		</u>
		Students should be able to read a real-world problem, create, and solve an equation using variables and numerical values. Literacy is addressed through the reading and comprehension of word problems. 
	</p>
	<h4>
		
		Assessment 
	</h4>
	<p>
		
		Mr. Jones will do a formative assessment by walking around the class and listening while groups of students are working on the Marta word problem. He can ask them questions to check for understanding. 
	</p>
	<p>
		
		Mr. Jones will do another formative assessment of his students while they play kahoot. He will analyze the data from the game when they are finished, as well as observe during actual play. He can then make decisions based on what he finds out to plan and make adjustments to his next lessons. 
	</p>
	<h4>
		
		Instruction 
	</h4>
	<p>
		
		Lesson Plan:  55 minutes
	</p>
	<p>
		
		(5 min)   Students should start with a warm up on the whiteboard to solve:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>54 + 7x = 117</li>
		<li>5x - 182 = 68</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		
		(10 min)   Direct instruction on how to figure out what the variable is in a word problem.
	</p>  
	<p>
		(10 min)   Inductive Instruction, Class breaks into groups of two or three to solve this problem:
		
	</p>  
	<p>
		
    (The problem is read out loud by Mr. Jones, and a printed copy is passed out to students)
	</p>
	<p><i>
		
		Marta’s mom is making a dress for folklorico dancing. The blue, satin fabric is $12 a yard. She needs 2 spools of thread for $3 each. If the supplies for Marta’s dress have a total cost of $66, how many yards of fabric did she buy? 
	</i></p>
	<ul>
		
		<li>
			
			Solution:  Let y = number of yards  
		</li>
		<li>
	    Equation:  12y + 6 = 66
		</li>
		<li>
	    y = 5
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		
		(25 min)    Social Instruction, Class will play kahoot using laptops and ipads. Questions asked will be based on finding the variables for real-world problems and solving simple one step equations. 
	</p>
	<p>
		
		(5 min)     Class will put away equipment and clean up to get ready to switch classes. 
	</p>
	<h4>
		
		Management
	</h4>
	<p>
		
		A proactive approach to management is generally highly recommended for teachers because of its effectiveness. Managing proactively means keeping learners productive with clear instructions, so that there is minimal or no room for misbehavior. In Mr. Jones’ class, some students have expressed confusion and have likely stopped paying attention because they feel like they do not know what to do. These students can benefit a lot if Mr. Jones is more clear or specific in his instructions. 
	</p>
	<p>
		
		Some of Mr. Jones’s students may benefit from a social approach to management. Marta and Aracely are known to work well together. Dillon, Bill, and Rukhsana are also potentially excellent team players. If implemented properly, the learning environment may feel safer and friendlier to all students. Ray may become more social. Steven may make friends. Gina’s attitude towards boys may become more optimistic. 
	</p>
	<b>
		
		UDL
	</b>
	<p>
		
		Mr. Jones will present information in a variety of ways by lecturing to the class and by presenting information through demonstrations on the board. Mr. Jones can post helpful diagrams in the classroom that illustrate Algebra concepts. This may be especially helpful to the English Learners. This is multiple means of representation. In addition, the students will express what they have learned by working with partners on word problems and by solving one step equations on kahoot. Finally, the students will be engaged in the learning process by working independently during warm ups, working in groups solving word problems, and by using laptops to solve simple equations on kahoot.
