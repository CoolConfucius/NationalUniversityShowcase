	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	
	<p>
		
		This document is a learning plan that serves as a follow up to the instruction I have observed. Information from my observation notes, interviews, analysis and reflection are applied in this plan. The plan will address all six instructional elements with supporting detail. The document will be organized in terms of the six elements: Learners, Teacher, Target, Assessment, Instruction, and Management. The plan will also address Universal Design for Learning. Multiple means of engagement and representation will be addressed in the instruction element. Multiple means of expression will be addressed in the assessment element. 
	</p>
	<p>
		
		Mr. Dobervich, the teacher I observed during this course, said he cannot give me feedback due to technical difficulties. So, I reached out to another Computer Science teacher for feedback. Mr. Ferrante’s comments are in <span class="green">green</span> and closed within [square brackets]. The <span class="red">red</span> text are my after-feedback additions. A summary of Mr. Ferrante’s feedback and a reflection on the feedback are at the end of the document. 
	</p>
	<h4>
		
		Learners 
	</h4>
	<p>
		
		The high school students are diverse in their gender, ethnicity, cultural backgrounds, and needs. Some of the students are involved in activism relating to contemporary events and societal concerns. <span class="red">The classroom is arranged so that the students sit together in multiple small clusters. This makes it convenient for students to work in small groups.</span> Computer Programming is not a required course for students, so the students enrolled in this course are interested in the subject. The students care about their learning as demonstrated by their productivity. <span class="red">They are on-task during in-class activities.</span> <s>They frequently ask smart questions and give smart answers to questions.</s> <span class="green">[In general, it’s best not to label questions, answers, or students as smart.  Rather, giving specific praise or feedback is recommended.]</span> <span class="red">They ask thoughtful questions that highlight important details regarding a concept or a lead to discussion that clears confusion. When answering questions, they often give a correct answer or an answer that leads to a discussion on common mistakes and why a certain answer is correct.</span>  
	</p>
	<p>
		
		Computer Science is a challenging subject even for adults. A great teacher can explain concepts effectively, but being a great programmer involves more than just understanding concepts. It also involves problem solving, being able to analyze a problem, applying the right strategy, and sometimes being able to come up with a creative solution to seemingly foreign problems. Some students may appear to excel naturally. Others may struggle and seeing some excelling with seemingly minimal effort can be discouraging. <span class="green">[True. I’m vocal about this at the beginning of the year and ask students to think about it through a running race analogy. If we all went out to the track this instant to run a two-mile race, students will run at whatever pace they can must. But with practice, hard work and effective effort everyone can improve immensely. And at the end of the day what matters the most is that the race has been completed, not how fast it has been completed.]</span> Especially important for this subject is to build a culture where struggling is not stigmatized, but to be expected. Learners should not think less of themselves because they did not come up with a correct solution to a complex problem immediately. Tackling challenging problems instead of sticking with easy comfortable problems is something one can take pride in.  <span class="green">[Yes, you nailed it.]</span>
	</p>
	<h4>
		
		Teacher
	</h4>
	<p>
		
		The individual or team applying this lesson plan is expected to have the following characteristics. Knowledge: they should be skilled in Java programming and have a deep understanding of computer science concepts, data structures, and object-oriented programming. They should excel in the assignments they assign their students. They need to have a thorough understanding so that they can explain concepts in an effective manner, anticipate questions, and be able to answer them properly. Beliefs: they believe that it is their duty to do their part in helping every student succeed. They believe not in simply presenting material, but helping students understand the material. Practices: they are both assertive and patient. They provide students reasonable support but also allow them to develop responsibility and independence. They interact with students in a way that gains their respect. They practice effective classroom management. 
	</p>
	<h4>
		
		Target
	</h4>
	<p>
		
		Students will know how to: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			
			create array lists: <code>ArrayList al = new ArrayList();</code> 
		</li>
		<li>
			
			Add elements to an array list using the add method;
		</li>
		<li>
			
			Access elements from an array list using the get method and know when to expect an “<code>IndexOutOfBoundsException</code>” error; 
		</li>
		<li>
			
			Remove elements from an array list using the remove method;
		</li>
		<li>
			
			Loop over every element on the array list. 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		
		Students will apply their knowledge of array lists to their T-Rex Runner project by building the feature where dots move in the background of the game. 
	</p>
	<h4>
		
		Assessment (UDL: Multiple Means of Expression) 
	</h4>
	<p>
		
		The students express their learning through these multiple means: answering the teacher’s questions, working on “Code Experiments”, and progressing on the T-Rex Runner Project. 
	</p>
	<p>
		
		Over the course of the school year, the students will take a number of tests. However, assessments to measure students’ learning progress must be done regularly. <span class="green">[True. These are known as formative assessments and are effectively a collection of “checkpoint” strategies to gauge student understanding.]</span> Asking students’ questions in class checks their understanding of the subject. <span class="green">[True but how you ask the questions and in what form students responds is a huge topic itself. For example, are you cold-calling students? Are you asking them to respond in a journal and then share with a table group? Are you using Think-Pair-Share. Etc. In general, I’d highly suggest a form that makes all students accountable for trying to answer the question and then gives them feedback on whatever it is they came up with.]</span> For example, the teacher may ask: 
	</p>
	<p>
		
		“When I create an array list, what is its size?” 
	</p>
	<p>
		
		“What happens when I try to access a location beyond the array list’s size?” 
	</p>
	<p>
		
		The Code Experiments are exercises that tests students’ understanding of programming concepts such as array lists. The T-Rex Runner project also challenges the students’ ability to apply their programming skills to solve problems. Checking in on the students’ work on in-class exercises and projects helps the teacher know the students’ learning progress.

		[The beginning of this lesson made me think this is the first day students will be using ArrayLists and that students may be lower-skilled than a typical AP class. Perhaps this is an Intro Java class. If that’s the case then the first four Learning Targets make a lot of sense, the target about looping over the list should probably be broken down further (lots of ways to iterate through a list), and the last target is probably way too much information if you want students to focus on getting used to ArrayList mechanics in the first place – at least for a single day. If students are already capable of something like the T-Rex project then they probably don’t need much hand-holding for the intro to ArrayLists. A question I have that should be answered by your lesson plan is what time is expected for this lesson. Is this a three-day lesson of 50 minutes per day, a single 90 minute lesson, or something else?]

		[Since I don’t know what students have been studying prior to this lesson I have little basis to make conclusions but I’m wondering why this lesson is mixing a first look at ArrayLists with object independence. Do students not already understand that each instance keeps track of separate copies of its instance variables? If this is just a review, then no problem. I’d say that for some students having a lot of extra details is like throwing a bunch of confetti in the air and asking them to pay attention to all of the shapes including the brand new one we added to the confetti today. Not my style. I very much like the On your own and Bonus questions as these are a good mixture of basic exercise proficiency and extensions for students who have finished the basics. Keeps everyone engaged and learning.]
  </span></p>
  <h4>
  	
		Instruction (UDL: Multiple Means of Representation and Engagement) 
  </h4>
  <p>
  	
		The subject material is represented through these multiple means: verbal delivery, questions and answers, writing on the board, illustrating concepts through diagrams, and demonstrating the coding process. <span class="green">[Physical demonstrations using manipulatives is also useful.]</span> <span class="red">The teacher may also bring out interactive toys that help illustrate challenging concepts.</span> 
  </p>
  <p>
  	
			These multiple means are applied for engagement: asking students questions to keep them engaged; giving fun projects such as the T-Rex Runner to make the learning process more interesting. 
  </p>
  <p><span class="red">
  	
			This lesson plan is intended to apply to a close to 90 minutes period. The teacher will allocate some time introducing Array List concepts. Part of this is asking and answering questions. During the rest of the time, the students will practice what they learned. 
  </span></p>
  <p>
  	
		The students care about their learning, so they may be able to pay attention to and learn from long lectures. However, this lesson plan follow’s Mr. Dobervich’s style, which keeps lectures to a minimum. This way, students do not need to worry about losing their attention. They learn concepts by asking and answering questions, and repeated practice. In most of the period, the students are practicing by working on the Code Experiments (examples are under the Assessment section) or T-Rex Runner. During this time, they will ask for help, and it is up to the teacher to “instruct”, provide the reasonable support the students need without diminishing the challenge. <span class="red">The students are not expected to finish or Code Experiments or complete the T-Rex Runner task by the end of the period.</span> 
  </p>
  <p>
  	
		To introduce an abstract computer science concept, it is often useful to apply a concrete analogy. <span class="green">[Excellent. Use this strategy as often as possible.]</span> The following is from Mr. Dobervich’s handout. 
  </p>
  <br>
 	<img src="" alt="IntroductiontoArrayLList">
 	<br>
 	<p>
 		
			The T-Rex Runner is game where players play as a dinosaur with the goal of dodging obstacles. The students have been applying their Java programming skills to build this game as an ongoing project. This is a fun project that trains students in the skills needed to be a developer in an interesting way. 
 	</p>
 	<h4>
 		
		Management 
 	</h4>
 	<p>
 		
		A proactive strategy to classroom management is known to be effective and is often recommended to teachers. Thus, the individual or team applying this plan is encouraged to apply proactive management. Being proactive in management means minimizing misbehaviors or disruptions. Times when students feel that they do not have a task to work on or do not know how to work on a task are times when students are more likely to be unproductive or even disruptive. <span class="green">[Very, very true. This is absolutely critical to seamless classroom management. If students become frustrated, some will act out in non-productive ways.]</span> This is addressed by keeping the learners productive with clear instructions (Sanford Inspire, 2017). 
 	</p>
 	<p>
 		
		It is fortunate that the learners in this plan are mature. However, the teacher will be expected to manage should a problem arise. Management is not so much about disciplining students, but building an orderly and effective learning environment. Students learn that there are consequences to their actions, thus they need to take responsibility for their actions. <span class="green">[Students don’t always respond to consequences. Sometimes they just need to know that you care about them and that you have their best interest in mind. The more a student is punished at home it’s probably a better strategy to give them some patience and love at school.]</span> There are regulations in professional settings and the public society. It is logical for schools and classrooms to have rules (Sanford Inspire, 2017). <span class="green">[These last two sentences seem somewhat random to me.]</span> <span class="red">The teacher has conveyed this to the students in their first meeting.</span> 
 	</p>
 	<p>
 		
		Throughout most of the period, the students will be working on a task without direct guidance from the teacher. The teacher will act as a facilitator and resource for the students. However, during these times, the students are allowed to “manage” each other. They are encouraged to keep each other productive and support one another when they can. 
 	</p>
	<h4>
		
		Feedback Summary 
	</h4>
	<p>
		
		A lot of Mr. Ferrante’s comments are affirmations of ideas expressed in my lesson plan. For example, he agrees with building a learning culture where struggling is accepted and being proactive in classroom management. However, there are suggestions that I have gathered from his feedback. Under Learners, I mentioned that the students ask smart questions and gave smart answers. Mr. Ferrante suggests not to label questions or answers from students as smart. Under Assessment, Mr. Ferrante listed multiple forms of in-class assessments. He suggests applying a form that makes all students accountable for trying to answer the question and then gives them feedback on their answer. Under Management, Mr. Ferrante points out that not all students respond to consequences. He suggests that I let students know that I care about them and have their best interests in mind. 
	</p>
	<h4>
		Reflection on Feedback 
		
	</h4>
	<p>
		
			Mr. Ferrante helped me realize the flaws in assessing students by asking them questions in class. Even if the student called on answered correctly, it is possible that many students could not answer correctly. However, the strength of asking students questions in class is that it is fast, and it gets the students’ attention. To make all students feel accountable for answering questions, the teacher can be thoughtful in selecting which students to ask. 
	</p>
	<p>
		
		I am glad that Mr. Ferrante reminded me that some students come from difficult homes and could use more patience and care. If a student misbehaves, instead of delivering consequences right away, I may talk to the student first. It is possible that their parents just had a divorce and they just cannot think about how to apply Array Lists in T-Rex Runner. By talking to them first, I am showing that I care and that I want to help. 
	</p>
	<p>
		
		Because Computer Science is a relatively new subject at K12 schools, I think Computer Science teachers have more flexibility for variety in the topics they teach or the kind of projects they assign. Mr. Ferrante’s comments on Mr. Dobervich’s Code Experiments is difficult for me to respond to. My focus as a programmer is JavaScript, which is free from Array Lists and other concerns in Java. Teachers teaching Java may agree that they should start with teaching simpler concepts first than complex concepts later. However, they may disagree which concepts are more complex. 
	</p>
	<p>
		
		I have observed both Mr. Dobervich and Mr. Ferrante. Although they teach the same subjects, I noticed them to have very different styles. The biggest difference I noticed is Mr. Ferrante gives long lectures while Mr. Dobervich keeps lectures to a minimum and uses the time to ask and answer more questions. While Mr. Dobervich goes out of his way to be engaging, I think Mr. Ferrante has a rapport with his students and trusts them to be attentive. This is something for me to consider when I teach. Taking my own personality into consideration, the style I choose for effective teaching may depend on the students I have. If my students benefit from stimuli, I may go for an energetic Mr. Dobervich style. If my students thrive under focus, I may go for a calmer Mr. Ferrante style.
