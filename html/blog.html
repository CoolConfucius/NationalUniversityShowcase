    <p><strong>Bio</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I'm Ben, born in 1990. My dream is to become a published fiction writer. I was born in San Mateo, but my family and I moved to Taiwan when I was just a toddler. I went to schools in Taiwan and graduated from an international school in 2010. After that, I went to California and started attending Santa Clara University for my undergrad.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I started as an English major, switched to a Psychology major with a minor in Creative Writing, then switched to a Liberal Studies major, then switched to a Computer Science major. In 2015, I graduated from SCU with a Bachelor&rsquo;s in Computer Science and a minor in Creative Writing.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>After graduating college, I&rsquo;ve attended software developer training programs. After that, I&rsquo;ve been doing software development. I found myself very unhappy with software development, and my intuition had been strongly urging me to switch paths. Reflecting, I&rsquo;ve decided that I would be happier as a teacher than as a software developer.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Why I chose teaching as a career</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When I was a student, I had very negative experiences in Middle and High school. Being on the autism spectrum, I was an easy target for both students and teachers. I want to be a teacher, so I can help students feel safe and have positive experiences in school.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Not wanting my computer science / programming training to go to waste, I want to teach computer science and programming to K12 schools. With the increase in demand for computer literacy, there should be a demand in computer science education. My current understanding is, not all schools teach computer science. And in those that do, computer science doesn&rsquo;t nearly have the same weight as other subjects. To my knowledge, there isn&rsquo;t a CSET in computer science, so I took my CSET in Mathematics.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>My personality type, teaching and learning style </strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I have gotten various results from multiple tests, but the personality type I identify with the most is INTP. I am highly introverted, and this is consistent across tests. I have an appreciation for both big pictures and details. I value being logical, practical, and honest.</p>
    <p>I have learned best by working with clear, unambiguous, instructions. I find examining examples and demonstrations and identifying patterns helps me learn more effectively than reading definitions. I imagine teaching in the style I have learned best.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>How this impacts my approach to teaching </strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I was a student in Computer Science and I know how difficult the subject can be. However, I do believe that, a lot of the difficulty comes from the way the material is presented by the college professors. My advantage is that I can present the material more effectively, thus making the content more understandable to K12 students.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Valuing logic and pragmatism, I will adopt practices supported by reliable evidence into my teaching approach.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As an introvert, I will be courteous to my students. I will show them that I care about their well-being and learning without overstepping boundaries.</p>
    <p><strong>My Teaching Philosophy</strong></p>
    <p>I believe I am responsible for preparing students to become contributing members of society. This means helping them develop knowledge, skills, and maturity. I also believe there is a time for a flexible learning environment where my students are expected to give input on what they learn. My role would be a facilitator who helps them succeed. In addition to helping students grow academically, I also believe in helping them mature into respectful members of society.</p>
