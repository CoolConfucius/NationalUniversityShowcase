    <h1>Computer Science / Programming Teaching Resources:</h1>
    <h2>Khan Academy</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">https://www.khanacademy.org/</a></p>
    <p>Khan Academy has a great reputation among Computer Science / Programming Educators and I can see why.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>One of their courses is:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages</strong></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-html/v/making-webpages-intro">https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-html/v/making-webpages-intro</a>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Learn how to use HTML and CSS to make webpages. HTML is the markup language that you surround content with, to tell browsers about headings, lists, tables, etc. CSS is the stylesheet language that you style the page with, to tell browsers to change the color, font, layout, and more.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I looked into the course above and I am very impressed from what I have seen. The lesson is exactly compatible with what I want to teach. The video gives a great introduction on the web and how HTML is used to build webpages. The idea of writing code may be intimidating to learners who are starting, but the video presents it as engaging.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The video itself is teaching my content area and an enhancement of what I would teach without the video. The video represents the content area in an engaging and easy to understand fashion.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The videos deliver the content more effectively than I can. It is obvious that the creators of the resource have more expertise in both Computer Science / Programming and Education than I currently have.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I would not take it personally at all if my students say they learn more effectively from an online resource than from my instruction. In this case, my role to my students would be to facilitate their learning, assess their learning progress, and support them in their learning.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Another course that seems very promising is:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Intro to JS: Drawing &amp; Animation</strong></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming</a>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Learn how to use the JavaScript language and the ProcessingJS library to create fun drawings and animations.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Code School + Pluralsight</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/codeschool">https://www.pluralsight.com/codeschool</a></p>
    <p>When I was in coding boot-camp, Code School helped me tremendously in learning Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, and React. This was before Code School joined with Pluralsight. The courses I learned from are no longer available. However, I expect the new courses to be further improved than the old ones that have helped me.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I judge the following courses to be promising replacements of the old courses I have taken:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>How Git Works by Paolo Perrotta</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>This course will guide you through the features of the jQuery "write less, do more" library</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning by Peter C. Brown </strong></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Peter-C-Brown-ebook/dp/B00JQ3FN7M/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534550481&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Make+it+stick">link</a></p>
    <p><strong>Publisher's Summary: </strong></p>
    <p>To most of us, learning something "the hard way" implies wasted time and effort. Good teaching, we believe, should be creatively tailored to the different learning styles of students and should use strategies that make learning easier.</p>
    
    <p><em>Make It Stick</em> turns fashionable ideas like these on their head. Many common study habits and practice routines turn out to be counterproductive. Underlining and highlighting, rereading, cramming, and single-minded repetition of new skills create the illusion of mastery, but gains fade quickly. More complex and learning come from self-testing, introducing certain difficulties in practice, waiting to re-study new material until a little forgetting has set in, and interleaving the practice of one skill or topic with another. Speaking most urgently to students, teachers, trainers, and athletes, Make It Stick will appeal to all those interested in the challenge of lifelong learning and self-improvement.</p>

    <p><strong>The Well-Balanced Teacher: How to Work Smarter and Stay Sane Inside the Classroom and Out by Mike Anderson</strong></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Well-Balanced-Teacher-Smarter-Inside-Classroom/dp/B009F0GF78/ref=pd_sim_129_10?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B009F0GF78&amp;pd_rd_r=2aad246b-a27a-11e8-8952-27c6af01512d&amp;pd_rd_w=aailo&amp;pd_rd_wg=PsqCY&amp;pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_p=a180fdfb-b54e-4904-85ba-d852197d6c09&amp;pf_rd_r=QCSVCXCZYVF436TNHWMH&amp;pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims&amp;pf_rd_t=40701&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=QCSVCXCZYVF436TNHWMH">link</a></p>
    <p><strong>Publisher's Summary:</strong></p>
    <p>You've probably heard the advice put on your own oxygen mask before assisting others. This is true both in airplanes and in classrooms. You have to take care of yourself before you can help someone else. If teachers are stressed out and exhausted, how can they have the patience, positive energy, and enthusiasm to provide the best instruction for students? Author Mike Anderson asked that question as a teacher himself, and the answers he found form the basis of The Well-Balanced Teacher. He found that teachers need to take care of themselves in five key areas to keep themselves in shape to care for their students.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to paying proper attention to their basic needs for nutrition, hydration, sleep, exercise, and emotional and spiritual refreshment, teachers also need.</p>
    
    <p>Belonging: Teachers need to feel positive connections with other people, both in school and outside school.</p>
    
    <p>Significance: Teachers want to know that they make a positive difference through the work they do.</p>
    
    <p>Positive engagement: When teachers enjoy their work, they have great energy and passion for their teaching.</p>
    
    <p>Balance: Healthy teachers set boundaries and create routines so that they can have rich lives both in the classroom and at home.</p>
    
    <p>Anderson devotes a chapter to each of these needs, describing in frank detail his own struggles and offering a multitude of practical tips to help readers find solutions that will work for them. When teachers find ways to take care of their own needs, they will be healthier and happier, and they will have the positive energy and stamina needed to help their students learn and grow into healthy adults.</p>
