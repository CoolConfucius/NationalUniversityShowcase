  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This page shows a list of 12 specific teaching strategies that I plan to use regularly throughout my unit and in my class. I gathered these strategies from online sources as well as the texts. Each strategy has a description on how it will help me engage students with my content or help me check for understanding. References are listed at the bottom.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In this list, the textbook or text refers to &ldquo;Tools for Teaching Conceptual Understanding, Secondary: Designing Lessons and Assessments for Deep Learning&rdquo; (2017) by Stern, J., Ferraro, K., &amp; Mohnkern, J.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Project-Based Learning</h2>
  <p>Chapter four of the textbook also describes Project-Based Learning as one of four instructional frameworks. And online resources support this. PBL focuses students on projects that deepen their understanding of the content and build skills applicable after graduation (Buck Institute for Education, 2010). PBL&rsquo;s advantage is it makes school more like real life and it has been shown to be effective (Boss, 2011). I find PBL to be compatible with both my subject area and teaching philosophy. I intend to center my lessons around building meaningful projects. Students are learning skills used by professionals to build the kind of projects built by professionals. This should be engaging to the students! When my students build their web application project, they are practicing writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When I look at their project and code, I am checking their understanding.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy</h2>
  <p>Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy is a common phrase used in teacher education and is discussed in chapter 1 of the text. In computer science, I will be teaching abstract concepts to my students. It is important that my students do more than just read definitions of those concepts. They will have to write code using those concepts. Only then, will they have proved to me that they learned. In computer science, and mathematics, the facts or definitions are often very abstract. Thus, it is more effective to start with examples that are more easily understandable. After learners are comfortable following and working with the examples, then the definitions or facts became understandable. And this may be the approach I take. I start with simple understandable facts, instead of a series of complex and abstract facts. Then I quickly go into examples. My learners have proven that they understand the principle generalization when they are able to code projects. Knowing the complete definitions will not be necessary. If my learners can build impressive websites, I don&rsquo;t need them to recite to me text stated on a documentation page.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
  <p>The Growth Mindset is a strategy described in chapter 2 of the text. In short, excellence does not depend solely on an innate fixed attribute, but takes effort and strategy to achieve. I agree that schools should train students to be active thinkers and not be passive learners. And I will do my best to build an open, safe, supportive learning environment. I want my learners to be comfortable sharing their understanding of the content. Computer science is a very challenging subject for college students and adults with degrees. My learners are not expected to master the material right away. It is challenging, and they can take pride in taking on a challenge. I am proud of my students for wanting to learn computer science and programming.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Concept Attainment</h2>
  <p>In chapter 3, the text describes Strategy #5: Concept Attainment and states:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When introducing a new concept, the biggest pitfall is treating it like a fact. Many teachers instinctively want to teach concepts like vocabulary words, offering textbook definitions and then quizzing kids on those definitions later. The problem here is that students, even at the secondary level, struggle to distinguish meaningfully between concepts and facts on their own. Left to their own devices, they&rsquo;ll dutifully go home and memorize definitions without really understanding much at all. Then they&mdash;and their teachers&mdash;will be disappointed when they can&rsquo;t apply or analyze or evaluate based on the concepts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Reading definitions is rarely an effective strategy in learning programming. In fact, it can be argued that it is easier to learn programming without long and complex definitions. I don&rsquo;t want my students to just recite definitions but understand them. I know they understand concepts when they can write code using the concepts they&rsquo;ve learned. To help them learn, I will present them with examples, guide them through examples, and give them plenty of opportunities to practice. Working with examples are also more engaging than memorizing definitions. I also check the students understanding by seeing their practice.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Uncovering and Transferring Understanding</h2>
  <p>Chapter 3 of the text describes Strategy #7: Learning as Uncovering and Transferring Understanding and Strategy #8: The Conceptual Inquiry Cycle. These strategies add on to Concept Attainment. Proper coding challenges not only assess the students&rsquo; learning of the concepts, but also requires them to think critically. The burden of thinking is on the students, not the teacher. Relating to the comic strip, the coding challenge is the locked treasure chest. The concepts I taught are the tools needed to solve thee coding challenge or open the treasure chest. But it will take skill to recognize and use the tools to open the chest. It will take critical thinking and creativity to apply the right concepts to solve the coding challenge. The coding challenges and web application projects are the contexts in which students will apply the concepts and deepen their understanding of them. This engages the students and also gives me opportunities to check their understanding.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Formative and Summative Assessments</h2>
  <p>Chapter five of the text describe the application of formative assessments and summative assessments. On formative assessments, the text states: &ldquo;Formative assessment happens throughout a unit and should be used to help students form their understanding of both the conceptual relationships as well as of how they learn. This type of feedback helps students push their thinking, get on the right track, and make sense of errors along the way.&rdquo; Summative assessments occur at the end point in the learning journey. Its purpose is to measure whether students reached the goal and, if not, how far off from the goal they were. Frequent assessments and feedback not only helps the teacher measure the students&rsquo; learning progress, but also helps the student learn more optimally.</p>
  <p>In my teaching, I plan to give my students frequent short projects and short coding challenges as their formative assessments. For a summative assessment, they will work on a major project and a set of more comprehensive coding challenges. The results of the assessments will show me my students&rsquo; learning progress.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Effective Feedback</h2>
  <p>Chapter five of the text describes the strategy of using effective feedback. The teacher simply stating that the students have not reached the learning objective is not as effective in helping students progress. Effective feedback not only states a clear goal, but also describes the students&rsquo; current work in relation to the overall goal. It should help the student figure out what to do next without providing all the answers. It is encouraging and specific.</p>
  <p>When I give feedback on a web application project, I would be specific on helping students know what their next steps are in completing the project. On a coding challenge, I would guide my students on thinking through the problem and remind them the tools that we have learned.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Use Models to Help Demonstrate Conceptual Understanding</h2>
  <p>Chapter five describes this strategy. From my own experience, I know that models or demonstrations are effective in learning Computer Science and Programming. When a professor present definitions and theories without demonstrating, it is incredibly difficult for students to understand how to apply those concepts. By paying attention to an instructor giving an example, students will be able to build projects even if they have not studied the definitions of concepts extensively. If I want my students to be able to build an interactive web application, the best thing I can do for them is to show them my process of building that project. I plan on using models throughout my teaching to help the conceptual understanding of my students.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Proactive Classroom Management</h2>
  <p>Sanford Inspire has an excellent module called &ldquo;Basic Proactive Classroom Management Strategies&rdquo;. This means I will structure my class in a way that minimizes misbehavior. I will have tasks for students with clear instructions, so students will have tasks to do and know how to do it (Sanford, 2017). In my class, the tasks will come in the form of projects or coding challenges. When students are on task, their learning is optimized.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Logical Consequences</h2>
  <p>Sanford Inspire has an excellent module called &ldquo;Creating Logical Consequences&rdquo;. I will guide my students to use reason to identify and assess their actions in the classroom. They need to understand that the actions they take have consequences. My implementations of consequences are not simple punishments but meant to promote student responsibility. When students arrive late to class for the first or second time, I will work with them to create solutions that help them get to class on time. Moreover, consequences I implement will be logical and related to the behavior. For example, the consequence for students who arrive to class late three times is that they have to make up for what they missed in class (Sanford, 2017). Students will be more effective in their learning when they take responsibility for their learning.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Classroom Rules</h2>
  <p>Sanford Inspire has an excellent module called &ldquo;Creating Classroom Rules&rdquo;. This is not about restricting students, instead, it is about freeing them. Rules are meant to make the learning environment consistent and structured, and thus safe for the students. This is analogous to having traffic lights for drivers (Sanford, 2017). When students are learning in a safe environment, their learning is optimized.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Universal Design for Learning</h2>
  <p>Multiple courses of National University&rsquo;s Inspired Teaching Program have shared multiple resources discussing UDL. CAST discusses and explores UDL extensively. UDL is: Multiple Means of Representation, Expression, and Engagement. The intention behind the multiple means is to make learning more inclusive. Content is represented in a way that all students can access the learning. All students can express their learning. And the instructor engages all students.</p>
  <p>Multiple Means of Representation: I may use visuals such as diagrams to represent programming concepts in addition to explaining concepts verbally and showing text and code from a projector. Learners who struggle with hearing learn from the text and code examples. The diagrams help learners who are not yet fluent in English to comprehend programming concepts.</p>
  <p>Multiple Means of Expression: I want to provide options for my students to communicate to me their knowledge and ideas on what I teach. To do this, I may allow them choices in in-class activities and assignments. This may not be effective in a Computer Science class however. Any software developer needs to be able to code. Likewise, to truly demonstrate mastery with programming concepts, my students need to show me they can code. That said, I have some ideas. Learners who struggle with typing but can write on paper have the option to write code on paper. I may even allow learners to verbalize their coding process if they cannot write or type.</p>
  <p>Multiple Means of Engagement: I want my students to pay attention so they can process what I am teaching them. Therefore, I want to make my class as interesting or relevant to them as I can. One way to do this is structure in-class coding challenging as games to beat. Games are fun and easy to pay attention to. I may also talk about fun and interesting technology and relate this to class by reminding them that software is built from coding.</p>
